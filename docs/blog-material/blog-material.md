Contract Review and Signing
If using a trust make sure to have buyer name/entity ahead of time. Need full trust name. Get the accountant to send you exact wording for the contract.
Building & Pest
Most things will just pop up in the first 6-12 months with a $3,000 - $5,000 buffer from the B&P.
Steps After Contracts Exchanged
Must meet contract dates so, be on top of broker, conveyancer as well as B&P. More specifically the broker, especially if you are sub 21 days or 14 days. If you have a 14 day contract you don’t have heaps of time to get your valuation done and formal financial approval. You need to be on the brokers back and pushing them to make sure they’re moving mountains to get that contract to formal approval as quickly as possible. If you let it go to the point to get an extension you open yourself to the liability and risk of that seller going “no, we don’t want to, we have a contract here for 50k more we are going to terminate this contract”.
Also, if you have formal finance approval you can then negotiate B&P issues as the agent and seller will be more inclined as they’re so close to unconditional and everything being wrapped up.

Introduction: Welcome to Sammy Gordon’s School of Property
It was just an intro
Why Property as an Asset class?
Super stable asset
Everyone needs somewhere to live
Less volatile
Tangible, you can force value
Rental return + capital growth
Australia is massively undersupplied
The power of leverage
Where Are You Getting Capital From?
Savings/cash
Equity from your own home
Equity from investment
Borrow 1st deposit from the bank of mum + dad

Overcoming The Fear of Debt
What’s your risk profile/appetite for debt?
Biggest thing to remember:
The banks are your friends
You have to embrace leverage and debt
Leverage is what makes property such an unbeatable asset class
If you’re nervous about it:
Start small
Build your confidence
And once you’ve had some wins, your willingness to embrace it will come
Equity and LVR Explained
Run through the basics:
Usable equity
Equity position
Example - A:
$1,000,000 property with $600,000 loan (60% LVR)
Usable equity is $200,000 as you bring the property/loan up to 80% LVR
Example - B:
$500,000 property with $400,000 loan (80% LVR)
Usable equity is $0 but you could bring it up to 90% LVR by paying LMI
You could get $50,000 in equity and pay $13,500 (3% of $450,000) in LMI which just gets added to your loan. It's not an upfront cost so your deposit would be $50,000 and then add $13,500 at the end on top of your loan.
Refer to the finance module for deeper analysis + explanation
This was to give you basic understanding
How to Calculate Rental Yield
Solid metric for understanding opps from a CF perspective
Annual rent/purchase price _ 100 = gross yield
Example:
$500 per week ($26,000 p.a) / $500,000 (purchase price) _ 100 = 5.2%
Very useful tool/metrics to determine if a deal will work for you
How to Calculate Net Yield
Annual Rent - expenses / purchase price _ 100
Example:
$26,000 - $6,000 / $500,000 _ 100 = 4%
Another way to do it is to look at 80% LVR on the purchase price (debt) instead of the actual purchase price. Look at the debt on the property.
Example:
$26,000 - $6,000 / $400,000 (debt 80%) \* 100 = 5%
Portfolio Buffers
How much should you buffer?
Per deal?
Overall amount?
Risk profile
Economic profile
Of the property itself
How much do you make/compared to expenses
Sleep at night factor
In summary:
Everyone is different
You need to work out the appropriate buffers financially so you can sleep at night and also not risk it all whilst still putting as much as possible to work
Suggestion is 5k per property is conservative until you reach 30k
When you pull out equity from a property you could put some of them into our offset as a buffer
Good Debt vs Bad Debt
Bad debt is essentially anything that doesn’t produce an income
Personal loans, car loans, credit cards, all these things need to be paid off in much shorter time frame
Meaning the repayments significantly affect your borrowing
Snowball elimination of debt
Also, depreciating assets - wait, don’t use loans to get these
HECS - At 3rd deal you might run into serviceability cap with having HECS
Good debts:
Appreciating assets
Assets that produce an income
Focus on eliminating bad debt
And taking on good debt
To help keep your servicing strong
Capital Growth vs Capital Gain
Capital Growth is how much your property has brown by
Access capital via equity release
Capital Gain is the profit when you sell
CGT is triggered when you sell
People think it’s a dirty word
In Australia, several ways to minimise:
PPOR - fully exempt
Personal investment - 50% discount if held over 12 months
Structured investment - 50% discount if held over 12 months
How to Maximise Your Property Manager
Make sure they are pushing for top dollar rents
Balance between top rents + good tenants
If retaining good existing tenants, make sure not being lazy and keep in touching distance of market rents
Balance between top rents + good tenants
Send all outgoings to your PM:
Council rates
Water
Strata
You want someone who respects your time
And protects your headspace
Respect both ways (underpaid)
Always be checking your monthly statements
Ensure their managing efficiently and effectively
Final note: PM’s can make or break your journey
Be effective with your use of them
Keep it Simple
Property investing isn’t rocket science, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel
Keep it simple to start
Bank some solid wins
Rinse and repeat
I have seen so many go out on their first deal to knock over the most complex deal/strategy possible
Keep it simple, focus on getting the little things right
Build your confidence, level up as an investor
As you build, replicate other people's success
Look for a mentor
Make the most from the minimum input
Target growth locations for the early, early win
Final point: Focus on the numbers, no emotions!
Blue Chip vs Blue Collar
I’m a big believer in:
Spreading your risk
Diversifying locations
Better cash flows
A lot of the time lower areas come from a lower base
Lowers your risk via diversity in location and cash flow
Don’t let your ego get in the way, the numbers don’t care
In summary a good property or one you’d live in doesn’t automatically make a good investment
Cash Flow or Capital Growth?
Which should you target?
Always comes down to your specific scenario
What do you need next in the portfolio?
Don’t get fixated on one or the other
You will need both in your journey
Buy the right deal for you will help you in your journey
The wrong one will slow you down
Always comes back to your strategy
What do you need next?
Positive Gearing vs Negative Gearing
Interest rate environment will have a heavy hand in this
What type of income earner are you?
Lower income
Maintaining serviceability
Oxygen
Positive cash flow
Higher income (200-400k p.a)
Properties maintain serviceability
Weather slightly lower yields
Always understand your objective and the deal you need
Growth property (might cost you a little)
Have to look not at what something will cost, but what it’ll make you
In summary: no matter your position I wouldn’t get too fixated on this as a strategy:
Focus should be on continual accumulation
What properties do you need to get you to your goals
To Pay Off The Home Or Use Equity To Invest?
Old saying in the book you can’t savage your way to retirement
Invest while you can
Velocity of money:
Pay off home
Invest
Utilise leverage
In summary:
Most aussie retire asset rich and cash flow poor
Need the healthy balance between the two
Can’t eat equity
What’s an Assessment Rate, and Why is it Important?
When the banks assess you, they use:
Incomings
Outgoings
Prospective return on rent on investment
Actual interest rate:
Example:
Say 6% interest rate
Say 8% yield on your investment property
You’d think you have a 2% buffer so you’d think you could get additional serviceability but in reality the current buffer rate is 3% therefore your combined assessment rate is 9% (interest rate plus buffer rate).
The buffer rate might come down to 2%.
To summarise:
Every time you buy a property that’s only 5% yield you’ll be impacting your serviceability each time.
Buffer rate on top
Need to factor this into your numbers and forecast off this
An 8% yield is amazing, but not everything
You can see the difference above
Where creative lending and structures come from
Build Your Knowledge Base to be an Astute Investor
Doesn’t matter if you’re working with a BA or an advisor:
Education ensures you’re making the right educated decisions
I personally would have spent over 100k in property education
Many investors start by just buying anything…
Learn different strategies
Niche in on one that really makes sense to you:
Look at APS
We pretty much have 2 x niche strategies (at this point in time)
If you don’t have the time to become a master
Find someone who is and can execute for you at the highest level
Knowledge is an ongoing learning process
Always be learning even if you're outsourcing
Stay humble
People always willing to help the humble
Property Spruikers
No regulation in the property industry
House and land package (Be very wary)
Buyers Agent (dodgy)
Has your “advisor”:
Done what you’re trying to do?
Built many large portfolios?
Are they active investors themselves?
How qualified are they with real world experience?
Don’t accept any vague or fluffed numbers
Be wary of someone trying to make something seem super complex
In summary:
Listen to your gut
Go with someone with runs on the board
And has done what you’re trying to do
House and Land Package
Generally packaged by spruikers with comms built in
Typically terrible investments:
Landfill
Apartment blocks
End of the line products
Don’t get sucked into the “Depreciation Strategy”
Depreciation is not a strategy
FB ads
Established vs New Properties
Always pay a premium for brand new
Very hard to determine Market Value
Land content
Ability to value add
Potentially Gentrification
Houses over Units
Land Content
Scarcity
More desirable in 99/100 locations
At the mercy of strata/body corp
Proven outperform of houses over units for decades
Borrowing Capacity is Everything
You can’t succeed unless this is strong
Protect this at all costs
At all levels but especially lower income earners
Credit cards/personal loans
Spending habits
The game/goal of continual accumulation is advised through borrowing/finance
Most underestimate the importance of this
The lifeblood of your journey
Investing with the Hand You’re Dealt
Focus on the now and what you can control
Don’t let negativity into your thoughts
There’s a lesson further in (Ferrari)
Anything is possible
News
Don’t blame your circumstances
If it will take you 3 years to save 1st deposit?
Focus on what you can control
Don’t make excuses
Jimmy’s ep. tick box example
You’re either going to do what it takes, or you’re not
Investment Grade Property vs Buying Investment Stock
Investment Grade Property:
Ticks all the fundamental boxes
Growth location (will do 80-100% heavy lifting)
Desirable property (e.g., lock up garage, 3 BDR)
Established location
Suitable yield + vacancy rate (don’t go above 2%)
Setting the base/foundations for you to succeed
Investment Stock
Typically off the plan house + land or apartments
Stock list
Cookie cutter/bulk product
No scarcity
Setting you up for failure
Embracing Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)
Quick explanation
Insurance to cover the bank (not you)
Any loan above 80% LVR
Why is it so powerful?
Utilise smaller deposit
Get into a deal quicker
Multiple deals with smaller
Faster accumulation and faster journey
Who it suits?
Lower income
Lower deposit
Should you embrace it?
80-90% investors
Module 1: The Trident Formula
Introduction to the Trident Formula
Bread and Butter Deals
Foundations
Exit
Manufactured Cash Flow Deals
Serviceability
Long term cash flow
Development/Chunk/Debt Reduction Deals (DRD’s)
Building your knowledge base on the different deals for the portfolio
Bread and Butter Deals
Strong growth location, solid yield, below market value
Levers
Renovations (i.e., convert 3bdr 1bath to 4bdr 2bath by converting the garage to a master bedroom with ensuite)
Correct market will do 80%+ of the heavy lifting
Affordability is key (specific to region)
Affordability is better than high demand
Individual property suits demand of an area
Example, lock up double garage vs. open double garage
People won’t always pay a premium for a more expensive property
Cash flow at hold level
Won’t drag you down - bad is blue chip 1 - 1.5 million 3% yield you are bleeding
Good is 300-600k with 5-7% yield
The foundation is 2 to 1 ratio; 2 B&B at 5k negative each and 1 strong cashflow with 10k a year positive
Utility of the deal (not a forever hold)
Lower end markets have more room for growth
200k to go to 400k is easier than 400k to 800k and easier than 800k to 1.6 million
Timing the market vs time in the market
The art is in selecting
The right property
The right location
At the right price
To outperform the averages
Manufactured Cash Flow Deals
Game changing asset for the portfolio
Assist in retaining/boosting serviceability
Oxygen for the portfolio
Back end cash flow play
Retire on these deals
High net CF (multi income streams)
Very high due to dual income (granny flat)
Correct markets, rents will continue to grow
Areas that will grow in rent e.g., Melbourne/Sydney hasn’t grown much
Layering strategies on top of each other
Examples later on for strategies in more depth
Strategy 1: Below market value
Strategy 2: Cosmetic renovation (20-30k):
Paint
Floors
Fixtures
Fittings
Strategy 3: Structural renovation (40k+):
Kitchen
Bathroom
Strategy 4: Growth location
You’ll still get this with them just focussed more so on cashflow
Example:
Throw on granny flat
3bdr 1bath house and convert a single lock up garage with laundry at back into a master suite with ensuite at the back. Now you’re taking a $400 a week rental to $500 a week rental for the cost of 20-30k. That’s $100 a week return on 30k is 15% return.
Another example:
Say property is 7% yield and you buy 15k below market value now it’s 7.3% yield then you do cosmetic reno now it’s 7.4% yield then you do structural by doing the example above converting 3bdr 1bath into 4bdr 2bath and now yield is 8% and then throw a granny flat onto it. And now layer it into a growth location. In 2 years this is really achievable.
Another example to show to do and hold Cashflow vs B&B:
5 Cashflow Deals
550k all in (could be 450k property and 100k granny) (20% LVR)
8% yield (by layering all strategies listed above)
$850 a week (45k per annum gross)
Costs 15k per annum
Netting 30k x 5 = 150k per annum
5 B&B Deals
550k all in (20% LVR)
5% yield
$530 a week (27.5k per annum gross)
Costs 10k per annum (including 20% debt)
Netting 17.5k x 5 = 87.5k per annum
Some other examples:
Duplex/Unit Blocks
Rare to get good yields anymore
Look for 9% yield
Be wary of rates
Understand council
Look for renovation upside
Granny Flats
More advanced (build)
Better net yield
Solid depreciation
Look for reno upside
Commercial
Can be great
Longer vacancy periods
More $ to get in (20-30% deposits)
Development Deals (DRD’s - Debt Reduction Deals)
Introduction to developing
Can be a great strategy (for the back end)
Build your base first
Common mistakes:
Doing it too soon in your journey
Getting your timing wrong
Taking you out of the market for a while
Trying to stretch your capital
Not for entry level investors - build your base first
Different strategies:
Big renovations
Buy + builds
Can make immense money if timing perfect
KDR
Duplexes
Feasibility
Subdivisions
Run accurate
Townhouses + units
Marketing super important (especially for bigger projects)

The Correct Property (Asset Type to Start)
One of the biggest mistakes I see people make
Focusing on the next “hotspot”
Focusing on the “where” of the deal, instead of the “what”
B&B (growth) or Cash Flow
Question I ask and assess for every clients portfolio
What do you need next?
Equity/cash vs cash flow/serviceability
If you chip in lots of deposit you don’t need to worry about the external market conditions (valuer) to accelerate and keep that momentum
Need to work out which one you’re going to run out of first so you can keep moving forward before hitting a wall.
If you’re stuck at 3 or 4 properties vs 1 or 2 you’ll get significantly more growth.
How to work this out
Which one do you need? Are you a good saver, if so, then focus on equity.
Equity/cash
Understand what cycle of the market your properties are in. Can you tap equity?
Cash flow/serviceability
Are you a high income earner? Can I save hard?
How long will it take you to get another deposit?
Always keep an eye 2 deals ahead
Need to ask broker borrowing capacity/servicing beyond this deal? If the projected purchase price for deal 1 is 500k and minimum yield is 5% give that to the broker, give them the worst case. Then they can factor it into their numbers to calculate how much servicing for deal 2.
“You have a borrowing capacity of 900k and this deal is going to eat up 500k based on the worst case scenario 5% yield.”
Example, say you could only acquire 3 properties and their all growth before hitting the wall. Say it’s worth 1.2 million, say you get 10% of growth in 12 months that’s 120k of equity. Now you want to look at which one is going to max out first and sell it to then acquire a cash flow property.
Example,
Let’s say property 1 is with a mainstream lender at 300k and it’s gone up in 6 months and you pull out 50k equity. And use it as a deposit to buy property 2 with a mainstream lender at 300k and it’s gone up in 6 months to 50k.
In that same time frame property 1 has gone up another 50k as it’s been 6 more months. But now you’re maxed with that mainstream lender and now you combine the 2 deposits 100k (prop 1 equity 50k and prop 2 equity 50k) and you ask the broker price of property you can get.
They say 1 more deal at 400k, so now you combine the 100k equity and do a manufactured cash flow deal at 300-350k and build granny flat 150-200k.
If the broker says if you do the CF deal you won’t be able to do another deal after that Sam suggests you instead do 2 B&B’s instead rolling equity from prop 1 into prop 3 and prop 2 into prop 4. At 300k each. Now you have 4 B&B’s.
Be realistic on your own situation and where you are
Good saver, or average?
Low income, or high income?
What about low income, low deposit?
Regenerating initial deposit
Do you need this?
Beginner or established investor
What about a hybrid deal?
Both high CF + great growth deal
Can’t have both as your CF deals are ones with multiple titles on the same property (granny flat) and this takes ages to execute meaning equity takes a while. Same applies for growth, you cannot get great yield.
Remember each deals purpose
CF
B+B (growth)
Always keep your eyes 2 properties ahead
To keep moving as long as possible
Summary
Understand what you need next
Keep the bigger picture (end goal in mind)
You’ll need both deal types, but not necessarily same time
Execution and Sourcing
Time to take action
This is arguably the most important step
So many people build the strategy, do the research… but then never pull the trigger
Important question to ask
Can you do this yourself or do you need a BA?
Need to be completely honest with yourself
If doing it yourself
Are you capable?
Do you have the time to do it properly?
Can you negotiate? (How much experience?)
Can you 100% select a growth location?
If using a BA
Have they done what you’re trying to do?
Before they were a BA…
If you’re working with APS, you’re working with the best in the business
If not, be very wary of the sharks + the sprinters
Using a BA (The right BA) should mitigate certain risks + maximise outcomes
Selecting the correct growth location
When is the right time to exit
APS will contact you if they think a market your property is in is tapering off they will contact you
Access to more properties (off market)
Understanding market value intimately
Understand the local markets (get on the ground/level market knowledge)
Negotiate like a professional
Should save you more than they cost + put you in the right market
Have a network locally you can lean on
Can be the mentor in your team
Vested interest in your success
If going alone
Watch location research modules further in
Remember correctly asset selection for where you are in your journey
In summary
The game has changed
Not saying you have to use a BA but go into solo deal sourcing with your eyes wide open
Most important point to win at property you need to buy property
Reassess, Rinse and Repeat
Presuming you’ve started out with a good B+B/growth deal
Nice discount, good growth location, decent yield
Look to rinse and repeat the strategy
Example
B+B 400k
20k below market value
10% growth
Now 40k growth
Now 60k total equity can use a 60k deposit
This will get you into a 300k property but can’t in capital cities anymore. Need 400k for capital cities so need to add cash savings to get to the 400k.
Let’s say you buy 300k B+B regional with 20k below market value
Note this may have taken 6 to 12 months.
6 months later you value this and get 10% growth now it’s 30k growth
Now you have 50k equity
50k deposit will get you into a 250-270k property
Let’s look at property 1 which has now done another 8% growth on the which is 40k growth now we can use 50k + 40k equity to get into another
90k deposit and buy a 400k B+B - 20k below market value
The average australian on 80-90k a year salary will hit a wall right now
At this point you’ll probably need to use a trust to get another deal
If serviceability permits Sam’s had clients get 3 B+B within the first 12 months with total equity of 140k going into year 2 for 2 more B+B’s at 350k each.
At 6.5% interest rate those 3 properties could be 4k a year negative each.
So, you might use the 140k equity to do 1 CF deal at 80% LVR at 600k including a 200k granny which is 12k positive.
Now you’ve balanced your books
You’re farming equity and yes you’re increasing the debt each time but after 4 years with growth you can sell it and remove all that debt and have left over cash
Remember to revalue every 6 months
Next steps… reassess
Broker, cash, current position
Decide on next deal type
If prop 1 in example above has gone up 200k in 2 years then maybe it’s near the end of the cycle. Understand how much it was before you bought it and how much growth it has now when thinking of selling and when thinking of buying in the same location.
Where people go wrong is buying a B+B then thinking they’ll tap out soon so they buy a CF then are tapped out for 12-18 months as it builds.
Pre-empt getting stuck or maximise position if it’s the inevitable
Stay in the market or move on? Pros/Cons
Leverage on the experts around you + your mentor
Always be monitoring existing portfolio
Are deals still inline with existing strategy
Profit only happens when you sell the property, it isn’t the paper equity.
Selling B+B is apart of strategy
Sam assesses his portfolio once a month. What’s in there? What markets? What needs to be built on (from a CF perspective)? He has 3 or 4 builds going on at once. He pulls triggers on builds once every 6 months. Where are the rents at? When are leases up? Understand where each deal is within your portfolio and the properties within their cycle.
Execute, pull the trigger again
Bonus Chapter - Unstuck Yourself After Hitting the Inevitable Debt Ceiling
What to do when you hit the debt ceiling?
Almost impossible to not hit this, even with the most carefully laid out plans
Can getting stuck be avoided?
Should you structure differently from the start?
Most brokers and accountants advise no, I am of the same thinking
I will run you through an example client but some suggestions first
What can you do to increase serviceability
Reno to rent increase
Granny/auxiliary
Pay increase
Decreased cost of living
Refer to Finance Masterclass and Advanced Structuring to understand this intimately but I’ll break it down in a real life example
Liam Montgomery Portfolio
Property 1 - 45k deposit - 190k purchase price - 2020 - $340 pw rent - Older, bit of maintenance - 9.3% on purchase
Debt up to 250k roughly
6 months later get it revalued and rolled equity into property 2
Property 2 - 250k purchase price - 2021 - $370 pw rent - 7.7% yield - Value now (2024) 380k
Pulled equity out of Property 1 and put it into Property 3
Property 3 - 250k purchase price - 2022 - $420 pw rent - 8.6% yield - Value now (2024) 330k
Property 1 debt is now 250k and 7% yield with the equity pulled out
He now ran out of serviceability as interest rate exploded, he’s a low income earner, and he stripped out a lot of equity from property 1 to keep moving forward
At this point the bank would only lend him a 100k loan so the thought was do we build a granny for 100k can we buy something for 100k?
So, we went to the drawing board and decided we needed to sell something. So, assessed property 3 not going to sell as just bought and still got a lot of growth to go even though we’re up 30%. Property 2 is still charging and is up 50% but still has 50% more to go potentially and has granny flat potential. Property 1 valued at 370-400k now - lots of growth, lots of maintenance, lowest rent, sold for 390k
In 2.5 year window he purchased property 1 for 190k and sold for 390k - paid 36k in capital gains - paid out his HECS - paid 250k debt - 110k profit left after
Important thing is we checked with broker if we sell property 1 and it clears all the debt, clears all of HECS, it will increase borrow capacity to 600k
Goal for next property was target good yields - lower tier lending - cannot move to trust with this - hard to get cash out of this
So we set up a trust Pty Ltd Liam with 2nd tier lender - We rolled 110k cash into the trust - we bought in same location as property 3 - CF deal 1000 sqm corner block for 260k - House is a bit old, bones are good - When contractors build granny we also get them to give the house a facelift - 8.5% yield - put in 60k deposit
Property 5 - 265k - 800sqm block - 5min from beach - Can build granny - Unsure if going to CF this might just do B+B - 8.5% yield
Key thing about this is the trust is trading profitable with both properties returning 8.5% yield - If the debt in the trust isn’t taking care of itself you cannot move onto another trust
Debt for property 4 & 5 in trust is 450k with 100-150k debt left over (as borrowing capacity was 600k)
What’s good about this is we can extract equity and the yield will still cover the debt so it still trades profitably - so take out 150k and roll it into the next trust for property 6 & 7
2nd and 3rd tier lenders don’t have to factor in any trust structure debt you have that is trading profitable. If it’s trading negatively you cannot write off the debt and no one will lend you more money (even 2nd and 3rd tier lenders won’t). If trading profitable 2nd and 3rd tier lenders won’t even factor the debt into their numbers.
In trust have 2 properties have a B+B paired with a CF so it trades profitable and you can get another trust with another lender
TRUST MUST TRADE PROFITABLY - IDEA IS EVENTUALLY YOU REMOVE EVERYTHING FROM PERSONAL NAME
2 deals a year CF w/ granny && B+B in a trust
Continue to Acquire to Portfolio Requirement
We have run through how to take the step back, clear/reclaim the debt. Now time to build the portfolio to fruition
Focus on now/correct structures as advised by accountant
Focus on new/correct lending as advised by broker
Depending on lender/servicing/capital
Doing either 1:1 or 2(B+B) :1 ratios moving forward
Accountant will write letter saying it’s trading profitably and you can take this to broker
Building to portfolio requirement
Look at how many B+B’s you have in personal to work out how many you need in trust to meet i.e., the 150k net passive
Sam does 2:2 ratio with 1 B+B in personal so it’s 3:2
Assess B+B/growth in personal names and add to the overall ratios
What do I need next and Mr or Mrs broker how much serviceability in trust?
Strategic lenders rarely will all be the same lender
Reminder what CF deals are in here for from this point
Serviceability not lifestyle
Correct accumulation through here, should be able to build to completion
Remembering to time exists for your B+B’s
Remember to sell properties in different financial years to reduce your tax
Once portfolio built out if PPOR was part of the goal either this or DRD’s should/could be brought into the portfolio
Consolidation Phase & The Final Piece (The Strategy That No One Ever Talks About)
This is probably my favourite piece, or one of them
High income/yielding properties owned at a low debt level
This comes through sell down
And debt reduction
Financial freedom isn’t just about retiring
It’s about freedom of choice to do whatever you want
Low debt, high yielding CF deals
Consolidation + selling off B+B’s to pay off CF deals
Not too early, not too late
Timing market exits
Why sell, it’s been such a great asset?
The deal has done what it was meant to do
Bank the profit, clear the debt, move on
If you acquired extra growth deals for your PPOR, time to get excited
Either to buy it
Or to pay it out
Summary
Just remember what the B+B’s where in the portfolio
Their utility
Equity harvest and debt consolidation
[APS Summit] Selecting the Correct Sales Agent
Some good selling agents will sell off market, 95% good selling agents will want to go to market to demand as much market value for your property as you can. The good agents selling off market will have a list of buyers agents to sell to.
Looking at selling agents stats:
Days on market
How many sold in suburb
Not necessarily gamebreaker, need to look in combination with total properties sold
Total properties sold
Price can be skewed so don’t look at it that much
How many properties sold as lead agent
How many days advertised
Look at how many days on market and how many properties in sold, days on market might be medium/high but could sell a lot
Remember agents negotiate buyers down on price, negotiate sellers up on price, they just want your business
Don’t really go with a principal, someone who is the head honcho…
Example
Fadi
Days on market: 43
Sold in suburb: 36
Total properties sold: 95
He tries to say he’ll go for top dollar, over appraises to win your business, then takes twice as long to sell it as other agents and dwindles you down on sale price
Darren
Days on market: 31
Sold in suburb: 36
Total properties sold: 83
Christian
Sarah
Days on market: 16
Sold in suburb: 36
Total properties sold: 83
Questions
What have you sold in the area?
What do you think you could get for it?
What would be your marketing strategy?
What’s your commission?
Get them to come back with an appraisal.
First person to cut is the person who takes longest to get back to you
Should be turned around 24-48 hours max
You want someone who is on top of stuff, you want them to hunt you to sign as a listing then how reactive will they be to people trying to buy your property
Range might come back at 780-830k, and others like Fadi says $1 million
If someone comes to you with an exuberant figure ask them to justify how they’re going to achieve $100-200k more than other agents. Occasionally you’ll get a gun explain but they won’t have 50% more days on markets compared to other agents. But it’s rare you will get that gun.
Could you ask why your median days is double others?
What’s appraisal comes back ask:
Can you justify how you’re going to achieve these prices?
What have you sold that’s similar?
What’s going to be your marketing campaign?
After this someone should be able to sell you, Sam wouldn’t call 4 people, he’d call 3. Who’s achieved the best price of a similar product, choose someone who sells a similar product.
Avoid Fadi types, someone who sells you a figure you won’t be able to get and you end up needing to sell for much less as property has been on market for 8 weeks with no offers.
You might not click with anybody, or you might have a great connection with one person who you trust and delivers to you well and you go down that avenue.
Module 3: Finance Masterclass
Accelerated Beginner Funding
Broker or bank to start?
Using mainstream lending
What is mainstream lending?
Pro’s
Speed of process + transactions
Valuations (ability to release it too)
Con’s
Lower serviceability
Why are strong valuations so important?
Maximising deposits
Speed of early portfolio accumulation
Can’t use them forever but can be excellent to start
If you use a 2nd or 3rd tier lender make sure to pick the one with the best equity release. 90% vs 80% LVR.
Final summary
I would start with mainstream lending if I would start again today
Maximise deposits + speed of transacting to fast track the journey
You won’t get to use them forever so enjoy them whilst it lasts
What LVR To Invest At?
What position are you in?
How hard do you want to go?
Beginner vs Established investor
Breakdown of units w/ 400k deal:
80%
No LMI & lower interest rate (1% difference)
88%
$5,763 LMI
48k deposit
352k loan + $5,763 = $357,763
90%
$8,543 LMI
$48,543 deposit
360k loan - LMI capitalised into loan
Risk rating increases considerably when you go above 90% LVR and your interest rate
95%
$13,887 LMI
380k loan + $13,887 = 394k
In summary
What would SG do?
Go for 88% LVR + LMI
Releasing Equity
Common questions
How does it work?
Equity from different bank?
If you can’t access equity from bank 1 you have to refinance with bank 2 to get the equity release
Does it affect borrowing? Increase/decrease?
Will be decreasing borrowing capacity as it increases your debt
Need to ask if we should release equity and sell property if it’s at peak of cycle and clear the debt? This will prevent getting stuck
How much should I pull out?
Pull out the entire amount and leave it in your offset until you need to use it while it’s sitting in offset you don’t need to pay for anything on that debt
Velocity of money - put your equity to work
Example
Property 1
500k value
200k debt
40% LVR
Sam would raise LVR to 80% therefore raise the debt level to 400k
Equity release is now 200k
Let’s say you buy 2 properties at 400k each and you put 80k deposit into each property + 20k for costs. So, Debt level on each property is then 320k which is 80% LVR.
Property 2 & 3 are now worth 500k in 12 months. So, you can now raise the debt to 400k as that’s 80% of 500k. So, you can pull out 80k equity and roll it into another deal.
Sam will work with the same lender for multiple deals until they max out
If working through trust structures max out with lender then open new trust with different lender
Cross Securitising vs Equity Release
Very common mistake (cross securitise)
Mum + dad investors
Early investors
Lazy brokers
Always the absolute last resort only otherwise always equity release
Separate standalone loans always best + profitable
Example
Cross securitise - Prop 1
500k value
300k debt
They give you prop 2 at 500k value and 525k debt at 105% LVR
When going for prop 3 you get a valuation for prop 1 & prop 2 but if prop 1 goes down 50k and prop 2 goes up 50k then they won’t give you anything as they look at them together
Equity release - Prop 1
500k value
300k debt
Bring debt up to 400k with 100k equity release
Roll into prop 2 at 500k value at 88% LVR
When going for prop 3 you get a valuation for prop 1 and it’s down but prop 2 they are happy to just look at prop 2 as it’s separate bringing LVR up to 80% or 88% LVR with a little bit of LMI as equity release to roll as deposit
Selling to Get Debt Back
One of my favourite strategies
Can be a game changer for your portfolio
Max out mainstream lenders
Everyone's situation is different
Using average aussie situation example
Super important
Sell off your bread + butters
Personal name as these markets peak at
Maximise profit through sale
Get that personal debt back
Example
Purchases are 6-9-12 months apart
Property 1
400k value
90% LVR
360k debt
12 months later bank gives value of 500k
Can lift debt to 450k so 90k equity release
Property 2
Roll 90k equity into it
400k value
90% LVR
360k debt
Property 3
12 months later bank gives another value on property 1 and it’s now at 600k
90% LVR on 600k brings debt to 540k which is 90k equity release
Roll 90k equity release into property 3
400k value
90% LVR
360k debt
After 3 B+B properties on average australian income you’re tapping out as the yields are low
Even if property 3 is 8% yield as it’s manufactured cashflow 500k debt with granny flat you’ll still be tapped out
Build out B+B’s and hit the ceiling, don’t turn to trust structures too early
We are 2.5/3 years in after property 1 and we’re going to sell at 700k which is
540k debt cleared from mainstream lending
300k capital gains - 50% no tax so 150k - 150k is taxed at most likely 30% so 50k tax - So, 300k profit is now 250k after tax
160k profit after paying down all the debt subtract 50k leaving 110k left over
110k back in the bank
Move debt to 2nd or 3rd tier lenders in trust and isolate the debt
So, if you've been investing for 3 years you’ve saved maybe 35k and you’ve got 25k left over cash on property 2 + 3 that wasn’t used from the equity release. That’s 60k plus the 110k back in bank that’s 170k to move into trust
That’s 900k worth of purchasing so get B+B (400k) and Manufactured cash flow (500k) debt isolated within trust 1 ensuring it’s trading profitably
Now getting the 2nd trust with 2nd/3rd tier lender they just look at prop 2 and 3 debt as trust 1 is trading profitably and you get the capital from prop 2, 3 and trust 1
Rinse and repeat!
Power of Lending Through Structures
Example
1 million borrowing capacity
250k cash (50k will be for costs)
So, 1.2 million purchasing power
So, buy 3 properties at 400k each
Or buy 4 properties at 300k each
Or buy 2 properties at 600k each
You will get stuck. You want to understand how much borrowing you can get in your personal name vs trust
Negative gearing can be added back in personal name making servicing slightly higher
Sam would start with 2 deals 300k each B+B - 7% yield - neutral - mainstream lender
Then move into trust structure - trust 1 - 2 deals at 300k each - could be big4
As long as trust 1 trades profitability it retains borrowing capacity by isolating the debt
When you move onto trust 2 - 2nd or 3rd tier lender - higher servicing - they isolate trust 1 as it’s taking care of itself
They give you 1.2 million purchasing power + 200k costs = 1.4 million - 600k (2 300k properties) debt = 800k to play with
Trust 2 will be higher interest rate as 3rd tier lender so we can’t do 2 B+B’s as it won’t be profitable
We do 1 B+B at 300k
And 1 cashflow at 300k + 200k granny flat
Totalling 800k
Property 1, 2 and trust 1 might be 12-18 months
Trust 2 might be 12 months longer
Now after 2-3 years we move into trust 3
After 5 years we might sell property 1 and/or 2, get debt back and capital and move into trust 4 etc.
Importance is to ensure each trust is running profitably and after 5 years move everything into trust
Remember first few years is going to be really slow and then it will snowball
Once you sell all your personal name properties it will explode
The Pro’s and Con’s Between Different Lenders
Mainstream
Pros
Stronger valuations + re-val policies
Typically faster
Easy process (if different with bank)
Solid netbank services + apps
Cons
Lower servicing
Regulated more tightly
2nd + 3rd tier lending
Pros
Stronger servicing
Many are non-conforming lenders
2nd tier rates + fees can be reasonable still
Cons
Poor re-val policies
They will give you business at 88% LVR but won’t let you release equity until 80% LVR
Generally higher rates + fees
Can be slower
Generally clunky/non existent online platforms
Common Mistakes in Lending
Debt recycling
For PPOR not understanding tax deductions don’t use cash to invest use equity
Rentvesting
Home debt is not tax deductible
Use your capacity to buy investment property you can borrow more money and it will work for you
And potentially the rent your paying can be tax deductible
Stay home with parents for a year or two whilst you invest aggressively
Rent where you want to live - where you want to live in 5 years is going to be significantly different than now
Thinking your capped out
Working with the right broker allows you to see what you could tweak to increase capacity
Check every 6 months
Cross Securitisation
It’s a bad thing, don’t do it
Choosing lender based on rates
Cheaper rate but some are online and don’t allow you to release equity
0.5% doesn’t really make much of a difference
Leaving equity in PPOR
People try to reduce the debt on PPOR as much as possible and lose out on the opportunity to use that money elsewhere
Valuations
10-15% variance with lenders if it’s desktop or non-desktop
Don’t base your next move on a valuations
Get 3 valuations in total
Staying with mainstream bank or not using a broker
You have different capacity with different lenders that change by 100k sometimes
Get use to using a lender you haven’t heard of
Balancing the portfolio evenly across equity/growth and rental yields
Need to have a conversation each time with broker they might say you’ve got heaps of equity but it’s getting tight on servicing so maybe go for the high yield property or you’re servicing is plenty so go for that high growth
Not reassessing what they’re doing regularly
Every 6 months if nothing has happened but if something has like pay increase, paid loan down, inheritance, rent increases
LMI not embracing LMI
Can’t save fast enough to keep up with market
Only put 12% down, buy property now, it’s tax deductible, even if you have 20%
Parent guarantor
Instead of using cash use a parent guarantor
Saves on LMI, saves on fees, it’s actually really good
SMSF
People think it’s too complex and costly but the return is good
Pre Approval
Don’t assume you’re approved until you’re actually approved
Construction Lending
You need a separate pre approval for construction than normal property loan
Lots of documentation you need to then get valuation
Need a fixed price contract to get lending
5 stages
You only pay interest per stage per release not the full amount
E.g., stage 1 slab $50k now you start paying interest on $50k
Bank will come in after each stage to inspect
You don’t want any delays as that may cause the builder to put in variation which is extra costs
Lots more content… I guess look back if needed

Carnegie Accounting
Make sure to work with an accountant that is a property accountant and also has a large portfolio themselves
Rules are constantly changing so always check with your accountants if that info is up to date
Discretionary trust
Appointer very important
Settler
Trustee
Beneficiaries
Can be setup within a week or two, setup ahead of time
Cost varies from state to state
Unit trust
Not common, for commercial
Individual trust
Joint tenants vs tenants in common
Tenants in common are really good if someone is going to be on a higher tax rate and it’s negatively geared. We can do a 100-0 split to reduce taxable income. Or, if someone is in a riskier position e.g., lawyer, doctor
SMSF
Tax rate 15% and 0% tax rate when 60 or above
3 months minimum to set up
Have to consult a financial planner and broker to see if can afford it
Need accountant to help setup
Cannot release equity, must sell, so it’s used for CF
Pricey - 4k+
SMSF can only be set up when property is ready… I think
Companies
No 50% CGT discount

The three factors when purchasing + hidden factor
Asset protection
Is my job something that can be sued?
Income tax
Do I have a high amount of tax rate that can be offset?
Land tax
Borrowing
Planning ahead of time
What state is the property going to be in
Will there be changes to my personal circumstances
Will the property be positively geared or a capital play - depreciation
Will I ever reside in the property
Will I ever develop the property
Has the bank confirmed my borrowing capacity
Estate planning
Benefits of using a Discretionary Trust
Asset protection
Ability to distribute profit among the family group
Access to the CGT discount
Liability Security with a corporate trustee
Borrowing
Succession planning
Questions to ask your accountant
Make sure your accountant is fully aware of your current situation and your plan as best as possible
Has your accountant setup these structures before
Does your accountant have these structures
What are the ongoing costs
Are there any upcoming changes that will impact this structure
Are they aware of the different stamping & contract requirements of each state
Other items to consider
Lack of grandfathering and how it will impact the structure
What is the land value of the property in the structures
Will I be holding this property long term or selling
Speak to a financial planner with an AFSL if setting up an SMSF
How are you going to manage your trust throughout the year?

Setting Up Trust Structures Correctly with Nick Fowell
Setting Up Trust Structures Correctly.pdf in google drive
Most people setup the structures incorrectly
Why do we use a corporate trustee?
Have a company be the trustee of the trust means that company takes on the debt not in your individual personal name meaning you can borrow more
The trustee must be a corporate trustee
Do not use one company against multiple trusts. Each has a land tax threshold and borrowing capacity. E.g., corporate entity Penny & Joey for Penny & Joey trust 1 then Penny & Joey corporate trustee number 2 for trust 2
Corporate trust structure
Each trust you setup you setup a new corporate trustee to take on the new debt
Who should be director of the trustee?
If using servicing of both partners then both of you on it. Director should only be the people servicing the loan.
Appointers
Very important must be set up right. This is the most important role, they’re the judge, god.
Need to double check who the appointer should be as they didn’t decide it. I think the appointer should be the person servicing the loan?
Witnessing
Some states will expect electronics and some wet. If you have the time then do it wet.
Stamping
Banks always want evidence of the stamping.
Date of stamping is very important - corporate trustee is setup first and signed - commencement date has to be the same date as the signed date
Steps
Sign corporation
Setup trustee
Then stamp
Then sign contract
If you’re in the queue with Sam for a property this trust should be setup before hand, before you’re in the queue
Kids and family members are beneficiary
Don’t put kids as primary beneficiary
ABN
Bank might want a ABN setup but don’t do it beforehand
You can also remove the ABN in couple of years
Get full name and trust structure for the contract way before hand
MOST IMPORTANT THING - YOU NEED THE NAME
The name can be anything, favourite character from a book or movie
Can be Matt 1, Matt 2, Matt 3
Don’t make up a word
Why do we move to a new trust?
Borrowing capacity and diversity (after 10 property mark) (I don’t understand this…)
Ask broker before hand if you have borrowing capacity so you know if you need a trust setup
Make sure you’re doing distributions
Person who’s getting distributed on the document needs to actually be distributed in bank account transaction

Understanding Tax Implications of Releasing Equity
Is releasing equity taxable?
No it’s not, you’re just increasing the debt level
You’re getting tax free money to purchase property that will then probably reduce your taxable income
Tax event is when you’re taxed
When you sell
When you get positive cash flow
Nexus
If you’re stripping equity and want it to be tax deductible then you need to use it for buying property
Don’t go out and buy a vehicle or do a home reno on your PPOR
If you want to buy a vehicle etc. then sell a property not equity release
It will make accounting really expensive, will poison the loan and make the ATO put a target on your back
When is it deductible?
Example - Individual where all properties are in personal name - You strip equity from property 1 to buy property 3 and 4. That interest should be declared on property 3 and 4. It doesn’t make a difference what you claim it on but if the ATO look at it they’ll think bad records. What else are you getting wrong? When your accountant does your tax return they should be allocating that portion of the interest amount to property 3 and 4.
Example - Stripping equity from personal property and putting into trust AND stripping equity from one trust to put into another - Trust must claim that interest, not your personal name. You must get a formal document that says you’re charging the interest to the trust at market rate.
Carnegie will give you a spreadsheet to show where you’re allocating the money when stripping equity.
Formal loan agreement
Only needed if you’re claiming the interest
It’s just a small letter that can be at market rate variable loan (couldn’t get all the info from vide).
You don’t have to charge interest to the trust. You can wear the interest in your personal name so you don’t make the trust even more negatively geared.
If the trust is about to break even or slightly behind or slightly in front. If you were to charge the interest you’re paying in your personal name to the trust you might hinder yourself from getting that accounting letter that says the trust is trading profitably, not allowing you to ring fence it and continue moving forward. Yes you then might not get to reduce your taxable income as much but it will allow you to get into another property or two where the benefits outweigh the cost. You pay $1,500 more in tax but also get a property that grows by 100k. Opportunity cost.
Change frame of mind: A lot of people get stuck at property 3 and 4 because they just think how much tax can I save vs. what do we need to do to get to the next step?
You don’t have to charge interest to the trust but if you do it must be at market (being variable) rate or nothing
To get the accountant letter that it’s trading profitably
If you need it 3 months from now then dump some money into it now
Evidence
Show bank account going up in value
Show profit and loss
Show the rent is higher than the agents fees, council rates etc.
If you do maintenance it doesn’t get taken into account
Tracking all equity stripping via spreadsheet
This is the original loan, this is what I stripped
The accountant will ask for the interest for the financial year. Need to give interest on the property/trust.
You say
The original loan amount from property 1
What was the refinance
Where was it used
Example, 1 million dollar loan on property 1 we then borrowed another 200k so now the loan is 1.2 million. But 200k of that is allocated to property 2 so we can allocate the interest between the two and that can roll on year after year after year.
Contribution into the trust
Sits on the balance sheet and can be drawn from tax free
Strategic we decide to declare it and pay that interest back from that trust or whether we’re doing the 0% and the personal name is copping it
When you’re contributing to a trust you don’t need to do a loan agreement
Interest is deductible for the entity that has the assets
Example, 3 trust portfolio
Trust 1 is doing amazing we’ve stripped money to buy property in trust 3
There needs to be a formal loan agreement between trust 1 and 3
There needs to be a formal loan agreement for every transaction
Debt recycling
It’s like stripping equity - turning non-deductible debt into deductible debt. Example, if you go out and buy your PPOR 1 million, the loan is 800k, say we get a windfall of cash and we pay off that loan, then draw against the equity of the PPOR to pay investment properties. We’ve now turned a non-deductible debt into deductible debt.
If you have a non-deductible debt that’s where your cash should be going. Not sitting in offsets against interest that’s deductible debt. We want to pay down non-deductible debt and make it deductible. We should strip it, put an offset against it, put money in the offset. Then if you need to pull it down for a holiday you can do that as the offset account is considered personal.
When selling a property rather than just throwing back into a new portfolio as a deposit instead throw it into your PPOR then draw down back on it. You’ve made the same amount of money but if you’ve made it deductible
Having conversations with your broker and accountant as you don’t want to dump 300k into your PPOR and then find out you can’t get it back out
Debt recycling is really good within unit trust, not so much discretionary trusts, but it can get quite complicated so speak to an accountant. Need to be able to show NEXUS borrowing the money and using it for tax deductible purposes
Money in offsets
Be careful when dumping money in an offset as some lenders will result in the loan closing as you’ve paid it off
Be aware of the loan terms, be aware of the limits
Common mistake scenario for trust (entity) to trust (entity)
Say trust 1 is trading profitably 15k positive, you draw down 200k, now it’s 3k positive (6% interest), you put it into trust 3 as it just started and now with the money it’s trading positively. You can’t do this as that interest is not deductible for that trust as that trust hasn’t used that money for tax deductible purposes. You need to do a loan agreement with trust 1 having interest income and interest expense and offset against each other making it nil. Trust 3 is going to have interest expense as it’s paying it into trust 1.
Instead, what you can do, put 200k into trust 1 from your personal name give it a few years it’s now trading positively now you refine the 200k from trust 1 back into your personal name. Now move that 200k into trust 3 to make it trade positively. You might not be able to the interest deductible on the equity strip. You can’t use it as tax deductibility. All you’re doing is shifting debt around and making sure things trade profitability.
Run scenarios by your accountant as you’re in your portfolio 365 days whereas the accountant is in there 10 days
Don’t expect everyone to hand hold you. You need to put in the work, professionals will help you as much as they can but you need to be all over it. No one is going to care as much as you do.
To make 150/200k a year passive it’s not going to be a cake walk
Eat shit for a couple of years and then it will get easier and the results will get bigger
Chat to your broker/accountant once a month to see what you can do next
Land Tax Workshop
Key Notes
It is a state based tax, each state has its own rules & rates - average over 3 years. Assessed end of calendar year
Each time you purchase a property check land tax as it’s changing all the time
Ensure your Property Accountant is aware of all land tax in each state
Your properties are assessed every year on their value
You may challenge the value but be weary of this
Land Tax is Tax Deductible
There are Land Tax exemptions in each state for Principal Place of Residence Primary Production. Differ from state to state
The Value of the land below the threshold is land tax free
It is only on Land value not property value
E.g., in WA purchase price is 400k the land is probably only 200-250k and the threshold is 300k therefore you don’t pay any land tax
Based on where the property is, not where the owner is located. Beware of Foreign Surcharges
We need to stress there are significant state to state variances on rates, foreign owners, trusts and land tax exempt properties. Make sure you are applying the right state and have reviewed with your accountant

When it comes to borrowing and land tax in WA when purchasing in a trust it comes down to who’s on the trust, who’s the trustee

You can see here this is why you want to max out your borrowing capacity in individual name before moving to trust as you can see there’s a massive difference between the thresholds and when you need to start paying

NSW is shocking to hold property in trust
Example Calc - QLD - Individual vs Trust
Nick owns one property in QLD and it recently had an average land value of $400,000 over the past three years
Individual - as the property is under the individual threshold of $599k, there is no tax to pay
Trust - as the property is over the $349k threshold land tax is assessed as:
$1,450 + ((400,000 - 350,000) x 0.017 = $2,300 in Land Tax for the Year
Backend strategy, in a trust you’ll have a B&B & a CF, you would eventually sell off the B&B and just have the CF in that trust. You want the CF across your multiple trusts to be in different states to minimise the land value in each state to minimise the land tax you have to pay.
Queensland Scrapped Changes
Proposed in 2022, the Queensland government proposed to tax owners of property in QLD on their nationwide holdings
So, effectively Queensland property owners who owned property interstate would pay land tax on those properties too
While the changes were scrapped, it gives an indication of where governments are heading as an “easy win” to close budget deficits
Land Tax in Structures
Grouping will become a significant factor with the introduction of Director ID’s states will be able to effectively group structures together
For example, Victoria has strict grouping rules. WA is on each trustee so not aggregated among related entities. Whereas NSW like Victoria aggregates related entities
So for example in WA you can hold 10 properties across 10 different entities and save tens of thousands every single year when compared to 10 properties in one structure
This is why its important to have different trustee companies
Each state has different rules around this
We advise all investors to assume land tax will be accessible on the property at some point, so work it into your feasibility study
Make sure to have a conversation with your accountant to look at your portfolio and look at where your trusts are set up and the properties and threshold. So, then for your next you can see where you need to put it. Okay cool next one is going to be QLD, are we still under the threshold? Great. That can go in the 1st trust, or do we need to set up the 2nd trust? To avoid the land tax as much as possible
Make sure you have this conversation before purchasing the property, you want to have this conversation before the pre-approval stage. What is the property I’m trying to buy? What is the price point? Where do we see the land value to be on that deal? Then strategy is going into personal name or trust? Do we need to open up a new trust?
Sam use to do this with Nick up to 20-30 properties deep
Then he got good at it and would set up all of his trusts before hand and check his rateable land value ahead of time and figure out where to place them within the trust
That’s why you want to lean on experts for rateable land value and borrowing side to keep moving forward
Make sure the broker and accountant are both on the same page. Ensure both know this next property is going to be in personal name or trust
Land Tax in Structures
When purchasing through individual names or structures, the ownership entity is assessed together. Always consider this when purchasing together
Example, Nick & Sam purchase a property together through as Joint tenants in WA that has land value of $500,000
We would then be assessed together and pay land tax being over the $300k threshold rather than just applying the $250k to each which is under the threshold and will still be liable for Land Tax
This is not the case in QLD
Potentially just buy individually, as doing it together you don’t necessarily get the extra borrowing capacity and extra land tax threshold
Each state assess differently, some assess as a partnership and others individually
Purchasing between states
While it shouldn’t be the overarching factor, purchasers can take advantage of the threshold in each state. You can see in the QLD example where it can be a significant deal per year
Additionally, make sure you have assessed the importance of The Three Factors when purchasing property as to where Land Tax is important to you in reference to the three factors

Cut off date for depreciation is 16th September 1987
40 years of depreciation from when it was built e.g., 1990 to 2030
What depreciation is
Allowance of wear and tear of income producing asset
Expenses such as
Interest on loan
Property management fees
They estimate the value of the property and there’s a marginal rate of wear and tear each year and it depreciates at that rate
Example,
You’re 100k a year and have a property that’s 10k a year positive you’re actually on 110k a year
2 components of depreciation items, building structure (hard fixed things, slabs, roof, structures) and plant equipment (carpets, blinds, kitchen appliances, vinyl)
New properties will always have more depreciation as the plant equipment is newer except you’ll have cases where someone has done $2 million renovations on their property in that case it would have plenty more depreciation
Unit vs house
On a unit you can claim depreciation on lifts, common driveways etc.
Example,
1970’s property where you do a $10k renovations
Because the property is built prior to the cutoff date you can only get division 43 asset at 2.5% on the $10k renovations meaning $250 a year worth of deductions
Wouldn’t recommend a report, do a spreadsheet of all your invoices.
Note, if you have worked out exactly your construction cost due to keeping well documented spreadsheets you could take that straight to an accountant. Whereas, if you don’t know the cost then you should go to a depreciation expert like Mike.
Example,
2003 property and $50k renovations
Someone else did the renovation and you just bought it
The beauty of this is you get to claim all the depreciation of the renovations without actually having to do it yourself. Actually, you can’t claim the full amount if they did some plant equipment and some building structure within the $50k you can only claim the building structure. Maybe you actually have $45k you can claim at Division 43 as that’s the building structure and the other $5k you can fully claim. Therefore, 2.5% of $45k is $1,200 + the $5k you then have $6,200. I THINK I THINK I THINK, MIGHT WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS WHEN DOING IT.
Example,
1990 property and you do $10k renovations with granny flat worth $200k all bricks
Estimating a 1990 home would be $110k to build with $10k plant equipment included, therefore $100k at 2.5% therefore, $2,500 worth of tax deductions each year. The $10k plant equipment is probably $250 as $40k of plant equipment is $1,000 deductions. And now the granny a $200k build gets you $10k per year Division 43 and plant combined.
Therefore, it’s about $12,750 per year depreciation
Meaning if the property is $8k a year positive you can write off that full $8k and the remaining $4,750 you can write off on your personal income
Division 43 you get per year over the life of the 40 years whereas plant equipment each has it’s own separate life write off.
Example, carpet has 8 years.
All plant equipment will probably be completely done after 10 years
The most juicy time is the first 4-6 years
Diminishing value vs prime cost - Should do diminishing values
You can claim the higher deduction earlier with DV
Clawing back depreciation… You can only back claim 2 financial years worth of deductions
APS Summit: Top Tips for Tax Time + How to Manage a 50+ Property Portfolio
Advanced_Accounting_Slides.pdf in APS Google Drive
You don’t necessarily want to minimise tax as it does hinder your borrow capacity
Most common mistakes on tax claimed by investors are
Interest from equity strips (the only thing about stripping equity from property 1 and putting into property 2 and claiming from property 2 or something, one of the previous sections covered this)
If you strip equity from an individual property and use it as equity on a trust that interest should be a part of the trust. Because the individual and trust have different tax rates the ATO are missing out on tax as a trust might have a lower tax rate.
Negatively geared properties consider doing pay as you go (POYG variation) variation
Write into tax office say you are going to have a big end of year deduction so talk to your employer about withholding less tax so you then receive more money per week instead of a big refund at the end
If you’re losing over 10-15k then you should definitely do this
It’s roughly about $70 per week back into your pocket if so
Example
10k negative cashflow in portfolio
Depreciation of 30k write off
If in 30c tax bracket
When employer changes POYG variation
You won’t get the big lump sum of 20k at end of year
They will deducting it from the tax you’d be paid each paycycle
Do CGT calculations before selling property
So, you know if you need to put money into super to offset it
Land tax
Gets issued on 31st December every year
Check with accountant if under trust if they received it via email
You can mostly do it online now
Repairs and maintenance and capital works
Example, roof got destroyed via weather event, client put new roof on - think it’s repair and maintenance, it’s not, it’s capital
Difference is
If you’re returning it to existing state then that’s repairs
E.g., if you do a patch up job on paint then it’s repairs
Maintenance is damage from tenants
If you do a whole new paint job that is improving the asset then that’s capital works
Painting is depreciated at 2.5% per year if you do 20k paint job you get next to nothing return
Anything over $300 is depreciated if it’s less than $300 you can write it off straight away
E.g., if you do kitchen renovations but the fridge cost $200 you can write that off
Before doing any work ask your accountant if this is going to be repair or capital
Capital is improving it upon it’s existing state or previous state
Insurance is income
Can pay income tax on insurance
Example, insurance claim of 10k - roof was worth 8k when it was destroyed - you’ll have 2k worth of income to pay tax on - you then get new roof worth 20k - you’ll get $300 tax deduction this year
Renovations
If you can avoid doing renovations specifically for B&B until you are ready to sell
Even if kitchen is not unbelievable when you buy it
If you do 40-50k outlay now and get equity uplift and can write it off at 2.5% which you have to pay back when you sell it anyway
Instead don’t renovate (hopefully yields are good) until you’re ready to sell it as it’s being added to the capital base
You put in 30-40k and will get 100k return as unrenovated to renovated product in that area is massive difference or you could do cheaper one as that’s what the market wants
If you renovate just before sale it means you can get that money back sooner
For CF do them when you need to do them to maximise return
When exiting market
Sam will let you know 3 to 6 months out notice when to exit market to give you time to vacant tenants and renovate
Depreciation
Speak to accountant about getting these depreciations or even MCG Surveyors
When APS finds you property and you have 5-6k worth of work to do unless it’s available for rent technically that has to be depreciated.
Repairs before property is available for rent is capital and has to be depreciated and means it will take ages to get the money back
To get around it make sure the agent has at least listed it so you can write it off straight away
Div 40 and Div 43
If you pick up the house turn it upside and shake it everything that comes out is Div 40 and everything that stays is Div 43
Div 40 is your plant equipment
Fridge
Dishwasher
Oven
Div 43 is structure
When you sell that property whatever you deducted as Div 43 gets added back on the sale. So, all those depreciation deductions you claimed and got big refund of you need to pay back to tax office at time of sale
So, if it’s a CF you want to claim Div 43 as much as possible as you’re going to hold it forever. But when it’s B&B you’re going to flip in 3-5 years time you need to keep it in mind it will be added back
Sam's personal broker is Geneen and personal account is Nick
Make sure your team is meshed and gel
If buying SMSF go through Nick else don’t do it at all as it’s VERY VERY TRICKY you need to setup your bare trust once you’ve found the property so you have a time limit
Can claim phone cost against your properties
Stuck on lending - Accountant won’t write letter that it’s positive
One off costs should all be ignored like
Accountant fees
Repairs and maintenance
Use prepaid interest, capitalising interest, prepaid rent
To at least make the property looking positively/trading profitable for a period of time so the accountant can write the letter
What costs can we exclude? How long do you need me to have the property trading profitable?
Principal repayments or depreciation aren’t included
Can’t just change accountant when receiving no as they need to put down how long they’ve putting working with you
Managing properties
0-5 properties use spreadsheet (cloud storage)
Sort by property, sort by trust
5+ use Xero or how much time you have or how much you make
Give Xero file to broker and they can log into that getting a loan done is in less than a week as everything is there
Sam managed up to 20 properties via spreadsheet because of his income
Remember you’re going to need to transition it to Xero eventually anyway
Can give it to your accountant and it will also be cheaper, can give it to lender and give you servicing straight away
Spreadsheet is available via school of property covers all key data you need
Lender will still ask for source docs
If you’re not across your spreadsheet nobody else is
Track
Yield on purchase
ROI on debt
ROI year on year
Equity base
Debt
LVR
Estimated rental increases
Profit and loss for each property
Should always be talking to lenders how much they can borrow
Keep your spreadsheets update constantly (once a week/month)
You can then see how much equity you can release to get another deal
So you can push it harder and snowball it
To keep finger on pulse for exiting
Nicks Xero setup
Portal where Sam loads in his property info throughout the year
Xero file that’s connected to the bank feed
Contact with the agent
Contact with the bank
Most of the data flows automatically
Bookkeeper reconciles it
Allows profit and loss to be printed out with click of button for each property
Including balance sheet, cash summary, equity splits
Bookkeeper just reconciles 5 transactions a month doesn’t cost much
Now we have live data throughout the year
We can then give it to accountant, can give to lender
Accountant should charge you less as they don’t have to do as much
Audit perspective Xero allows you to attach your invoices if ATO audits you it’s all there
Accounting fees should be less
Broker fee less
Can look at by property and by trust and by portfolio
Nick’s Xero setup costs $50 per month
Bookkeeper costs $50 per property per month
SPREADSHEET IS VERY IMPORTANT AS AUDITING GOES BACK 7 YEARS
SPREADSHEET IS IN GOOGLE DRIVE AS Portfolio Tracking Spreadsheet.xlsx
APS Summit: Tax Loopholes and Tactics Every Investor Should Know w/ Nick Fowell
After your accountant has prepared your tax return give it to your broker to see what they can do as they might help you to not reduce your servicing by claiming something for $1,000
PPOR related you don’t need to claim which one is your PPOR until you do tax return. Get a real estate to do a valuation… something something.
Can move out of main residence and sell it within 6 years tax free
Don’t make a land tax declaration to avoid land tax else you can’t do this
6 month rule you can have 2 at one time before selling before you pay capital gains tax
Try to get the highest appraisal/valuation ever when you move out of current PPOR to increase your cost base and reduce your tax later on
DIV 40 is dishwasher etc.
DIV 43 is structural
Properties purchased since May 2017 cannot claim DIV 40
When you sell the property you can claim the capital loss of those items (I think DIV 40)
Make sure if you do repairs you put it back to it’s original state vs improvement else it’s depreciated over decades
Banks borrowing fees that statement and stuff with discharge fees, annual fee, monthly fees, interest, LMI etc. are all deductible over 5 years. The year end June 30th doesn’t always include everything.
Equity strips, interest is claimed against property that the strip is earned. E.g., you pull out $200k equity from property 1 to put towards property 2. While it’s securitised against property 1 it’s not deductible against it. It’s deductible against property 2. It’s the exact same tax result but if you tick the wrong box you’ll be on the ATO audit list.
If you pull equity from personal properties it’s not deductible in personal name if you’re using it to purchase in trust. The interest is only deductible in that trust to claim it you need a loan agreement.
If you have under $500k in your super if you haven’t maxed your contributions in last few years you can put more in if you need a larger deposit for your SMSF property. And it’s all tax deduction. You can chip in $360k over 3 years deductible as well (I think).
Within a trust you can distribute capital gains to people who have capital losses to reduce tax.
You can also distribute gains from 1 trust to another trust that has losses. Secondary beneficiary is any trust or company that you control can receive distributions, not just whats listed on the schedule in the trust deed. This only works for capital gain against capital loss and revenue gained against revenue lost.
When you’re planning liquidity of properties you want to do it across multiple years. The date a capital gain is when you sign the contract (dated) not when you receive the money. Only need to worry about this if you’re not in the highest tax bracket. Also, need to take into account opportunity cost if you waiting…
On settlement statement council rates, land tax, strata those things are deductible straight away. I believe this is not referring to the ones you usually pay on going, this is specific to settlement the previous owners share.
Pay you go variation.
Pay as you go installments check your MyGov
Careful for land tax. Land tax is only done via post not email. So make sure the mail is coming to your property.
Can claim home office if you are putting it towards investing portfolio, ask accountant about this (phone, computer etc.)

Options
Option 1
Buy 1 x property every 10 years or so
If you have enough for more a decent commercial deal
Option 2
What Sam does
Strategy position
35 years old/$200k in super
Leave $50k with financial advisor to invest elsewhere
$150k starting capital
Buy through a bare trust with one property in each bare trust
Buy Property 1 - $500k
In 6 years we’re up 60%
Now we sell Property 1 and now that banks us $300k with $50k in costs, therefore profit is $250k
Now we’re 41 years old with $400k ($250k profit and $150k starting capital
Now we buy 2 properties at $500k each with $300k deposit with a $100k buffer
In 6 years we’re up 60%
Now we sell Property 2 & 3 and now that banks us $600k with $100k in costs, therefore profit is $500k
Now we’re 47 years old with $900k ($500k profit, $100k buffer, and $300k starting capital)
Now we buy 3 properties at $600k each with $500k deposit
Now we could buy 2 more residential properties or we could go commercial
We now buy commercial at $1.5 million with 6% NET yield which is $90k income per year - 20% deposit on $1.5 million is $300k + closings = $400k
Set a commercial on 15 year P&I by the time you hit 62 years old you probably own this thing out right or very close to it. You own the commercial outright, let’s say it’s $75k per year NET (conservative) - CF for life, hold for life
Now you’re 55 years old with 60% growth on those 3 residential properties
That’s $360k per property with $300k profit per deal after tax and closings
That’s $1.4 million ($900k profit + $500k deposit)
Now you buy a $2 million commercial property with $1.2 million deposit at 40% LVR (60% deposit) - 6% NET yield - $120k per year NET passive
You could set this on a 10 year P&I paydown and probably be able to pay it down sooner due to the high deposit
We purchased 8 deals in 20 years
By the time we hit 65 years old we have roughly $200k per year NET passive with zero debt

Self Managed Super Fund Lending
It’s becoming a lot easier to buy property with SMSF
You can now:
10% deposit
Interest only
Offset account
Serviceability wise
Super contribution
Amount in your super
Predicted rental yield of the property
SMSF don’t need to know how many properties you have outside SMSF or how much you spend on coffee
If you bank a huge profit and going to have to pay lots of capital gains you could put a bit in your SMSF to reduce tax
STEPS
Go to broker first to work out borrowing capacity
Then talk to accountant/financial planner, they’ll setup SMSF and trustee
Then broker will lodge pre-approval
This could all take 6 weeks
MISTAKES
Don’t put name of SMSF on contract put name of bare trust
Cannot setup bare trust until you have found a property, but you can already have the name of the bare trust and put that on the contract
CONFIRM WITH ACCOUNTANT/SOLICITOR/BROKER WHAT NAME TO PUT DOWN
Some lenders require liquidity
Money in bank account % of purchase price of property
Statement of advice regarding financial planner? Something, something, something…
Hard to scale in SMSF as you cannot get equity out and serviceability is just based on the super contribution (27.5k) and your rental property
To really scale you’d need to buy other things in SMSF to produce income within such as from like dividends
Recommended minimum super to get started is 150k on 500k property but could do a lot less
Doesn’t impact personal borrowing unless you make extra contributions
Don’t really recommend going down SMSF until you max out your personal name
Module 6: Advanced Investor Strategies
Compounding Growth - The Eighth Wonder of the World
Scenario
$100k cash
No issues with serviceability
PPOR worth $1 million - $500k debt

Last column talks about putting in 100k to buy a property worth 500k after the first year you make 10% growth and buy a property the year after and that does 10% growth as well and keep buying 1 property a year and make 10% each year what you end up with
Create some goals are scenarios around this and what you could do
In summary - compounding effect of growth
Plus continued accumulation
What level of investor are you now and where do you want to get?
Velocity of Money
Understand the cycles (this is always somewhere growing or priming for a boom)
Reposition your dollars
The idea of holding property forever is plain idiocy
It’s a myth any one location is better
In summary
Don’t leave your money to devalue via inflation
Make your money work for you
Treat your portfolio like a business (don’t be emotional)

Buying Cash
Benefits of buying cash
Secure best possible price
How soon should you do it?
Established/advanced investors
Advantages/disadvantages
Can get good discounts
Capital intensive
Short settlement times
Different strategies
Timing the Market vs Time in The Market
Such a common debate in the property world
For growth, I’m all about timing the market
For cash flow, time in the market

Buying Counter-Cyclically
Basically it’s about timing the bottom of the market, going against the herd, buy before a market goes for it’s run
One of the hardest things you can do
If you get it right, one of the most lucrative
You have to be 100% on the drivers
Be wary of getting it wrong but bullish if you think you’re right

Manage Your Portfolio as You Scale
Clustering properties
Rental perspective
Sam has
In Brisbane 20 rental properties in 1 area with 1 PM
In SA he has 9 properties with 1 PM
In WA he has 20 rentals with 2 PM’s
You can negotiate a better fee, better rate, better service
If you have 3+ rentals in one area you’re becoming very important to that PM
Growth perspective
If you’ve done the research you should do at least 2 deals per area
Don’t be in 20+ areas as it’s harder to build that relationship with a PM
Focus on quality PM relationships
They will push for top rents
Look after you as if it’s their own deal
Sam always has a chat to the principal and if they aren’t the PM for your property he’ll have a chat to the one managing his property
Separate email for property correspondence
Makes it easy to find all invoices
As it gets big, could get a bookkeeper involved
They can manage your emails
Make it easier at tax time
Could setup a spreadsheet for all your maintenance, rates, bills, rental income
They can let you know what property is performing and what isn’t
Sam didn’t pay for one until 30 properties in, took him a month worth of weekends to complete at tax time
Become assertive and decisive
Refinance
Quotes
Lease renewals
Should you paint it this or that
Shower screen or curtain
More properties, more things each week
Quote always ask for 2nd or 3rd quote
If they send you an appraisal for rent and if it doesn’t look right, ask
A lot less stress, things more faster
Don’t get bogged down on the smaller details
Bad PM heaps all the stress onto you
You letting everything build up
Understand How Much Growth A Market Has In The Tank
Bottom to the top
Very important if you’re entering or exiting a market
If you’re coming in late/missed the early growth, how much is left?
Affordability relative to values is key to understand
What is the max purchase price in similar markets with similar affordability, that gives you an idea what your current market might get to
Single or multiple income
Gentrifying
Average wage per household
Are they in industries receiving large pay increase (i.e., tradies at end of covid)
Rental growth/movement
If rent is stagnant it won’t go as high
People cannot afford their homes so they move to rentals which pushes vacancy rate up
Some markets don’t bottom out as much as others and therefore don’t grow as much
Knowing When To Stop Buying In The Market
Aka when is it too late to buy in a location
You need to understand your market correctly/intimately
“Dumb Money”
30-40% into a cycle
Hard to secure discounts at this point, same with FOMO
FOMO
This is the point to be wary
Understand the key drivers in an area to know when to stop
Be wary of areas where it’s investor driven
Be wary of buying too far in
Understand when there’s still room, and when it’s time to walk
Knowing When to Exit A Market
Nothing beats having a finger on the pulse of a market
Knowing local agents, sales agents
Things being passed in?
Sellers not going for ridiculous money anymore
APS try to predict 3-6 months out to have time to vacant tenants, renovate etc.
Getting ahead of this comes down to affordability
How much demand is from owner occupiers?
If high it almost purely will be driven by their affordability
If investor driven
Look at yield (stagnate rent)
How much stimulus is in the region/local economy?
In summary
Understand what is driving your market and how much growth it likely has in the tank
Manage an Insurance Claim Effectively
Sam has been investing for 15 years with 50 properties and 70 rentals and never had to make an insurance claim
He mitigated this by having exceptional PM’s, never undercut them
Basics first
Quality insurance provider
Terri Scheer, if they’re decently priced in the area
Terri Scheer is terrible in QLD as they did some big payouts a few years ago
Don’t underinsured your building insurance
Make sure you’re covered for what you need to be
Shop around, check annually
Always building and landlord insurance
For granny flat the building insurance needs to cover both
For granny flat the landlord insurance needs to be separate one for the granny flat and one for the main residence
Lean on your property managers to handle the claim
Give them your building and landlord insurance policy so they have it on file
Insurance payout is considered income
If you can get the insurance company to pay the trades direct
Take the payout you’ll owe tax
How to Use Property to Buy a Ferrari
Option 1: Poor man’s way (car loan)
8% rate/5 years P&I/$700k ferrari
$3,230 per week/$14k per month/$168k per annum = $840k total
Pro’s
You’ll own it outright
Con’s
Bleed for 5 years
No borrowing capacity
Very little chance of also building wealth
Option 2: Smart Man’s Way
Sam had 1 property that went through a significant growth cycle and he cleared $600k after tax. He bought 2 cars in cash worth $450k. He didn't feel like he earned the Ferrari yet.
Sam bought his after 14 years of investing
You could do it in 5-10 years
Buy your usual 8-10 properties (mixture of B&B’s & CF’s) to get to 150k passive income per year and at same time buy an extra 2 B&B’s to get to your Ferrari
Buy 2 x B&B
When they go through growth cycle sell them down
Pay tax, bank profit
Buy Ferrari outright
2 x $500k B&B’s 80% capital growth, sell down pay some tax
$350k profit x 2 = $700k
Pro’s
Buy it outright
Still been able to build wealth throughout
Con’s
Selling down and getting rid of asset
Option 3: Wealthy Man’s Way
Leverage Equity
$700k at 6% IO = $42k per annum
Still retain growing assets
You have 2 properties worth $800k each leverage the $700k equity and buy Ferrari as these 2 properties are growing at 5% p.a so $80k per year and it’s also got high CF
Discount On Way In vs Market Value In Booming Location
What about the combination?
Yes, can get both
Pros + Cons
Get into a booming location 12 months before it booms so you get a discount as well
Should you ever pay market value?
Should always be able to get discount
Module 7: How to Predict The Market
The Ripple Effect Explained
Such an interesting thing to unpack
Can be from the top of a market rippling down or the bottom rippling up
Stigma suburbs
Gentrification
Affordability
Is it city specific?
Event/infrastructure specific
Who are driving the market?

Circle explained
Say the centre (blue circle) is Toorak, highly desirable but really expensive. Eventually the demand gets pushed out to the nearer suburbs that have a lower price point as it is more affordable. And then finally reaches the black circle having the most demand as it’s very very affordable.
Even though the black circle was highly undesirable, lower socioeconomic areas people buying from interstate didn’t know about this. They just saw a 250k house vs a 700k house. The 250k house went to 500k and the 700k house went to 1.4 million over the next few years.
Key is to get the timing right
See the trends
Buy before it moves
Understanding the Property Cycle
Many people believe or try to say it’s a myth
The issue is they look at the market as a whole
It doesn’t work like clockwork
All markets move differently
Cities/States/Regions (Councils)
Markets top/peak out due to unaffordability
Bottom out after long periods of stagnation
Fresh economic stimulus reignites a market
Employment opportunities
Growth will do 80% of the heavy lifting

Module 8: The Step-By-Step How To
How To: Build a 5 x Property Portfolio with a $50k Deposit Making $50k Per Annum
Super important, maximise borrowing
Presuming living at home (if not, cheap housing)
Eliminate all personal debts, all bad debts
Credit cards
After pay
Savings history needs to be impeccable by property 2 + 3
Most banks only look at last 3 months, some look at 6 months
They see how often you go to maccas, door dash etc.
Remember building a portfolio on a lower income means sacrifice
Sam didn’t take any holidays from 21 to 28 years old, he would take 4 weeks a year to go and renovate his properties. No travel for 7 years.
A couple years sacrifice and I believe you’ll be able to build the following

Focus on
Property type - B&B/growth
Recycling equity
Lower entry price
Buy at a discount
High yield
Strong growth location
Right property, right location, right price
So important to this investor
Likely would’ve taken a few years to save
Example
All in personal name - Minimal to no land tax
100k salary
Property 1 B&B - 300k value - 30k discount - 7% yield
After 6 months it’s gone up 10% so now it’s at 330k value
At a 90% LVR we can pull out $55k equity to go into property 2
Property 2 B&B - 300k value - 30k discount - 7% yield
After 6 months it’s gone up 10% so now it’s at 330k value
At a 90% LVR we can pull out $55k equity + $10k deposit to go into property 3
Property 3 B&B - 300k value - 30k discount - 8% yield (need CF at this point for serviceability - we do a small reno)
At this point you’re most likely at a serviceability wall in your personal name
Very diligent, very frugal, right deals
Likely get to 3 of these
Move on to trust after selling deal 1
At this point property 1 is now 500k (66%) in 3 years which is normal, most properties top out in a cycle after 3-4 years
You had 240k debt on property 1 originally + the 60k debt of equity so 300k debt
You pay out the 300k debt from the 500k, now you have 200k, you have 100k tax free, it’s probably 30k needed to pay towards tax.
So, 170k profit and just got the 300k debt back
Now we move it into trust with a lower tier lender
The previous 2 properties rental yield has probably increased 1-2% as it’s been 6-12 months so serviceability numbers are now stronger
Now we execute a high CF deal for maximum $500k so maybe we put a smaller granny or a prefab granny where we only put in maximum $150k cash
Aim is CF deal that is dual income 8% yield
We aim for the trust to trade profitably
You can release equity from property 2 and purchase another CF deal in trust 2 ensuring it trades profitably.
And bam you’re at a 5 property portfolio
Roughly 3-5 years to reach this

Note a dual income CF deal at 10% is different to B&B at 10% yield as it’s dual income after taxes/expenses the NET yield will be higher on the CF
How To: Build a 10 x Property Portfolio with a $100k Deposit Making $100k Per Annum
Saving is still super important
Keep housing costs to a minimum
Be careful with personal debts. I’d still chop all personal debts out to achieve this
Focus initially on recycling equity, build out the foundations
Done correctly you might not need to sell until much further in
Allowing you to continue to build whilst markets peak out
Example
Build to 3 deals in personal names
Still retaining correct fundamentals of solid B&B/growth deals:
Strong growth location
Solid yield
Buy below market value
Purchase 3 B&B’s for $420k value - 6% yield - 88% LVR - $20k discount - so, $400k purchase price - $360k debt
First property you put in $80k deposit so, $20k cash left over.
Working off 10% growth rate
After 1 year property 1 will now be worth $440k and with that $20k discount on the way in we have $60k plus the $20k left over before total we have $80k deposit
Debt on property 1 is now $400k
We buy property 2 exact same as property 1
After another year property 1 would’ve had 10% growth again as well as 10% growth in property 2 so that’s $40k each so now we have $80k deposit for property 3
Property 3 is same thing as property 1 & 2
Now after another year we’ve received $150k ($70k from property 1 & $80k from property 2) worth of equity to extract from property 2 & 3 to go into trust 1
We buy 2 deals in trust 1, B&B ($300k purchase price) $50k deposit and CF ($500k purchase price) $100k deposit
Now we’re most likely maxed out with mainstream lenders in our personal name and cannot extract anymore equity
Trust 1 is profitable
It’s been 3-4 years since purchasing property 1 in that time it’s seen 80% growth so now we sell it for $720k
Basically we make $195k profit and clearing $465k debt on it
We can now use the funds as a deposit to move into trust 2
We don’t have any cash left over but because we cleared $465 debt in our personal name we can now farm equity from property 2 & 3 to move into trust 3 & 4

How to: Build $60k passive income (3:2 ratio)
Build $60k per annum net positive income
Perfect for phase building your portfolio
All banks factor in depreciation with properties in your personal name
Strategy will come down to starting position
What you need next in the portfolio
Most people can get 2 B&B’s with a 1st tier lender before hitting a serviceability wall. Ideally you can get 3 B&B’s before moving to a CF deal.
Most B&B’s at 400-500k are 5k negative CF per deal before tax. Most people can hold 2 of them.
Most CF’s at 500-600k are $10k positive CF per deal before tax.
Example,
Buy 2 B&Bs within first year then CF in 2nd/3rd year - all personal name - then setup trust and buy 3rd B&B in year 3 and 2nd CF in year 3
At year 4 just holding this portfolio will probably be $10k per annum positive
Year 5 or Year 7 you’ll start selling off the B&B’s and will give you $60k per annum net positive income
CF vs B&B
3:2 Ratio
This is the ratio to sell down B&B’s to pay down your CF deals
Exit/Consolidation

To summarize,
Buy 3 B&B’s $400k each - 75% growth in each one - that takes you to $700k each and you sell.
You will pay CGT if you’re a high income earner, probably best to do it in a trust so you can distribute that profit whereas if you’re not it’s best to do it in personal name and sell them year after year not within the same year to reduce your CGT.
Say you pay $50k cost selling each property - profit is $250k after tax (I think) and cost
This is achievable within a 3, 5, 7 year period

2 CF’s (granny flat on each) - $350k purchase - $200k granny flat build - $550k total
8% yield ($850 per week - $45k a year)
Total net CF $37k per deal
1 million debt on these 2 properties total
1 million minus the $750k profit from before leaves $250k
$250k debt at 5% interest rate is $12,500 a year
$74k a year per annum net subtract the interest that’s $61,500 a year net

Quality team
Broker
Buyers Agent
Accountant
Target
1 x $1 million commercial asset owned outright with 6% NET yield
Or a $800k commercial at 7% NET yield
2 ways to go about it
1 consolidate bank $60k NET passive and sit or,
Get to it but continue on
Trust 1 - Prop 1 - Mainstream
Prop 1 - $500k purchase - 12% deposit - 88% LVR
$60k deposit, remaining $40k stamps, ba fee, legals etc.
Debt $440k
Value on purchase $525k
6 months passes, equity uplift 11%
Buy running market, 3-4 year cycle, say we buy year in, we have 2-3 years left
$585k val now
Maybe you’re saving $30k a year, so now you’re at $15k savings in 6 months
We’ve gone up $60k in val since settlement
We pull $440k debt up to $515k, that’s $75k uplift
That means we have $90k equity position in 6 months
That’s enough to get into lower price point market ($450k) like units/townhouses
Presume don’t have enough borrowing capacity at this time but enough to equity release
People will make the mistake of buying 2nd prop in trust 1 resulting in them not having any room to further equity release down the line. So, we move into trust 2.
Trust 2 - Prop 2 - 9 months down the track - Tier 2
Prop 2 - $450k purchase - 12% deposit - 88% LVR
$54k deposit, remaining $36k stamps, ba fee, legals etc.
Debt $396k
Value on purchase $475k
6 months passes, equity uplift 11%
Saved $15k again ($30k a year)
Prop 1 had $65k growth - prop 1 debt is raised to
Prop 2 had $63k growth - prop 2 debt is raised to
Combined $143k deposit
Trust 3 - Prop 3 - 12 months down the track - Tier 3
Prop 3 - $500k purchase - 20% deposit - 80% LVR
$100k deposit, remaining $40k stamps, ba fee, legals etc.
Debt $400k
Value on purchase $525k
Trust 4 - Prop 4 - 18 months down the track - Tier 3

Focus on building the equity base
Protect servicing
Focus on running markets and quick wins
How to: Build $120k Passive Income (Updated)
Stuff
How to: Build $120k Passive Income (6:4 ratio)
Strategy very similar to $60k
Have to be more mindful of serviceability
Trusts will almost certainly come in
6:4 ratio (B&B:CF)
Don’t max out your personal name
Average aussie scenario
Personal
3 B&B (The 3rd B&B might come in later on after setting up some trusts and selling property 1 or 2)
1 CF
Trust 1
1 B&B
1 CF
Trust 2
1 B&B
1 CF
Trust 3
1 B&B

Consolidation
$500k debt at 5% interest is $25k per annum interest

How To: Build $250k Passive Income

You shouldn’t need to put in anything from your own pocket if you build it correctly
Should be able to build the 20 properties in 10 years and then wait a few years to consolidate to obtain the $250k passive income
Don’t put commercial and resi in same trust as the GST will then apply on the resi
We then buy more B&B’s inside the trusts and 1 in personal name to accumulate the 12 B&B’s total
We can put another B&B within a trust as the rent would’ve increased quite a bit over the time

How To: Build $500k Passive Income

In phase 1-3 you would’ve generated $250k from personal/trust and $100k from SMSF
1-2 commercial deals in SMSF
Sammy prefers option 2 as that’s even split of $250k in commercial and $250k in resi
24:16 ratio
Module 9: Income Boosting Strategies
Income Boosting Strategies
Ask if you can get early access to the property when unconditional to do reno’s
Dollar saved is a dollar made
Leasing and PM’s
Negotiate PM fee’s: Good PM’s will be quite expensive initially but once you put 2 to 3 properties within the rate would potentially come down
Get paid rent bi-monthly
Helps on reducing interest as interest calculated at end of month
Push for top dollar rents (don’t be stupid)
If you don’t get the top of the range in 10-14 days then drop it down
E.g., 10 days at $550 then drop to $530
If it’s not leased at the first or second open home then drop the price
You will attract bad tenants if you wait too long or you’re above market
Vacancy downtimes
Asking PM opinion what do they recommend as cost effective rent boosters
The PM might say it’s all good
Or they might say the door handles are crap, curtains look like crap, so for $1k to $2k with a handy man you could change all these things. Tenants would come in and see it’s all nice.
Ask what’s looking tired?
Maybe it’s the facade (outside area), clean up front yard, paint front door
First impressions count
To retain tenants
Say you have really good tenants maybe $450 a week but 12 months have passed and now the market rate is $550 a week if you’re going to lose those really good tenants by bumping it to $550 a week instead of maybe going for $495 a week.
Then you won’t have downtime and all those costs
Lenders
Switch/set as interest only
Push for lower rates, negotiate yourself or get brokers to push for you
6-12 months and never missed a payment and have multiple loans with them
Offset accounts + redraw (pros + cons)
Intelligent with offsets
Chat with accountant and broker what’s best when you have multiple properties and maybe a PPOR or P&I loans as you have tax deductible ones
Insurance policies
Combining policies
Goes up 20-30% after the first year so check and change
Example, insurance 1 was $1,500 then after a year goes to $2,500 but insurance 2 has $2,000 so got to them
Not allowing auto renew
Don’t do auto renew
Ensure you keep all your policy docs so you can compare from year to year
Paying expenses annually and on time
If you’re not concerned by your monthly cash flow then go with the annual
Make sure you’re staying on top of all your bills and statements
Depreciation
Short stay rentals + rent by the room
6 month lease & AirBNB during peak time
Rent by the room if near a university

Income Boosting Renovations
Bang for buck reno’s
Instead of just looking at something to fix/rectify it look at how much extra it would cost to replace and the value add it will do! You will get a better quality tenant as they think it’s been renovated.
Cosmetics
Paint
Biggest bang for buck
If you can just do 1 coat it will be a lot cheaper. That’s if potentially there were no smokers and the paint matches
If you don’t have the money to paint all exterior of the house then just focus on painting the front facade especially if you have a side fence or garage. Gives it a really good street appeal.
ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY IF IT’S WEATHERBOARD
If it’s red brick then spray/paint with white paint
Vinyl planking/vinyl cladding it’s expensive but it’s good if you have weatherboard that’s peeling
Go neutral colour schemes
Floor
Biggest bang for buck
Rip up old carpet and replace
Fixtures + fittings
Biggest bang for buck
Lights and door handles and cupboard handles
Remove crappy blinds and put in new ones
Landscaping
Minimalistic look
Do mulch and bark
Remove all scrubs and overgrown areas
Kitchen
Can you keep the existing carcass?
Replace benchtop or paint them. Granite look, put glue and crush rock and seal.
Paint kitchen cabinets with high gloss colour
Put on new splashbacks but aren’t always needed
What is the internal cabinetry like? If it’s old and crappy and moisture and chip board then don’t do it
If you replace the entire kitchen can you make the layout better? Speak to a selling agent or PM. Want to go for bang for buck for the market.
Bathrooms
Remove crappy mirror and vanities and put in cheap new ones
90’s on can probably keep but before that probably need to replace
15k minimum now to replace bathroom/kitchen
Bedroom + bathroom additions (extension + build ins)
Second living area doesn’t mean 100% you should put a bedroom/bathroom in there. Converting the front lounge room into a bedroom could be a good play. Need to be aware of the market.
Never go above 4:1 ratio (bedroom:bathroom)
If you have a 3:1 and can convert it to a 4:2 that could be a really good value add if you had 2 lounge rooms.
Don’t eat into the living space for the sake of it
Structural renos
Built in to lift a house e.g., in QLD you can stump it and lift and put new living space below the house. Really expensive at the moment.
Extension, look at how much it will cost and how much it will increase rent. If it makes sense then do it. But Sam says extensions don’t add up.
Builds
Granny flats, look at the cost. Right now the value doesn’t actually stack up.
New Builds for Cash Flow
Why are you building?
Equity or CF?
Granny flats
Detached
Best solution in every scenario
Attached
Best to source everything yourself
Don’t put shared wall places in lower socio area
1 title instead of 2 titles
Subdivide + build
These are capital plays, DRD
0 to 2 years to get the product to market
Duplex
These are capital plays, DRD
0 to 2 years to get the product to market
When chasing CF, which is best?
Renovating to Sell
Look to make the decision early
Reno on purchase, or down the line?
Speak to agents (understand your target market)
Dude renoed a 3:1 to a 4:2 by removing the garage but a garage was important in the market and so lost 50k
Some markets buyers are interested in non renovated products more than renovated
Cost vs return
Budget reno
Extension reno
Don’t reno
Budget reno
Bathroom and floor for 15k
Rip out vanity
Rip up flooring, do carpet/vinyl or carpet/hardwood depending on market
Kitchen for 2-3k
Sometimes the caracas is good
Could just put new cupboard doors on

Looking at the scenario above you can see the budget reno is 15k and gets you 550k
The expensive reno is 65k and you get 600k
The profit from both is the same, 35k
Most times in the lower market 400-600 k the budget reno is best. When an expensive reno is better is when it’s 1-1.2mil you could get 500k more profit from an expensive reno.
It purely depends if it’s for a first home buyer, investor or owner occupier
Extensive reno
Always assess for maximum return
Avoid double reno

APS Summit: Q&A with Sam & Team
Commercial could still grow like resi cashflow like 6% to 10%
In SMSF looking to sell down not equity release or recycle equity
For commercial it’s 80% LVR or less, no 88% LVR
Ask friends if you want to buy property in SMSF? Note, there’s no shareholders agreement like you do in private company so it can get nasty.
If someone wants to get out of a property in SMSF the remaining members need to pay them out in some shape
Monthly Q&A Webinars with Sam Gordon
[June 2024] School of Property Q&A
Depreciation within trust can’t be brought towards your personal name. I think it only works out when you sell a B&B to reduce the capital profit.
Remember that if you clear your HECS debt or any other debt in your personal name and that increases your borrowing capacity by $100k/$200k that gets applied to each trust individually, not as a whole. So, you can borrow $100k in trust 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 etc.
In Sam's trusts he has 2 CF’s and 3 B&B’s per trust
In SMSF for the first 2 properties go aggressive and then pair it with a property that will be bottom of market and rides all the way to the top. E.g., aggressive being 3 year turn around, safe slow property being 5-7 year turn around
If going through SMSF you must tell APS that you are so they source a very safe property that is good. As you cannot even really paint or rip up the carpets. The ATO will audit you and ask for your B&P and compare it to now.
When you make a profit it must be distributed somewhere by the end of the year. Either to your personal or to a trust/company.
In SMSF if you pay BA fee from your personal name you’ll never be able to claim that. If you do it within SMSF you can claim it when you sell the property. Also, if you own the property for more than 12 months in SMSF it will drop to 10c.
If you go on the MCGS website or other surveyor websites you can. Insurance broker cordel. These websites will give you a good estimate on how much it is to rebuild a home so you know how much to insure it for.
90% of clients that work with APS within 1st year or 2 are in the same spot as Sam 6 to 7 years into his journey.
If you want a $200k-$300k portfolio you can achieve that by building hard for 5 years and you’ll be there in 8-10 years after sell down.
People in their 70’s with a certain position could still buy property - especially if they have a lot of capital they could purchase a high CF property
Trademark vs. Foundational it really depends on your strategy/portfolio. The purchase price and source lead time is pretty much the same. The difference is BA fee, market discount and potential for renovation.

Incomes
High income is 200k+
Middle income 80-200k
Low income sub 80k
Sam has 3 property accountants that he likes
[July 2024] School of Property Q&A
At the moment no capital cities have house properties sub 400k
POYG withholding (pay variation)
When paying for maintenance within SMSF property it must come out of SMSF funds not your own personal bank account
SMSF holds a bank account. Bear trust owns each property. One bank account is under the SMSF, it doesn’t come out of the bear trust. You have 3 bear trust linked to the one bank account.
Capital gains is paid on cost base
Purchase price + stamp duty + BA fees + sales cost on way out + capital works done during = cost base e.g., $250k
Say sale price is $600k
Tax is $600k-$250k = $350k with 50% being capital gain tax exempt, so $175k and work this out on your individual income tax rate say 30c so $52.5k pay towards tax. So, total profit is $297,500.
You want to know how much borrowing capacity you would have for trusts. You would want at least 800k for it so you can put in 1 B&B and 1 CF.
Sam doesn’t put CF deals in personal name anymore
So, if you only have enough for 2 more deals in personal name then maybe do that in a trust instead
In trusts your borrowing is less because they don’t take negative gearing into account or depreciation.
If you only have enough borrowing power for 1 property in your personal and 0 in trust then go through personal if you can’t go into trust within the next 6 months.
To know when to start going into trust you need to look at if you have enough to do 2 properties in trust. If you can only do 1 then go personal. If you can do 3 then do 1 in personal first.
At the moment the aim is 400-700k
When selling
Ask a selling agent if it’s okay to sell whilst tenanted or vacant. If it’s a dominated owner occupier market you’ll probably wipe out 50-100k and 50% of the buyers if it’s tenanted.
If you have owned a B&B for 2 years look at the current market and it’s probably near the end of the cycle and find out if it's a high owner occupier or not as that will allow you to work out if you should keep it tenanted or not when selling.
Ask selling agent
How much could I sell it for as is (tenants are out)? Just doing a bond clean
How much can I sell it for if I improve (spruce up) it a little bit? Cosmetic facelift 15k. Bathroom, kitchen, floors, door handles, light fittings.
How much can I sell it for if I go all out? 60k reno. If it's a high owner occupier area this is probably the best option. If it's an investment grade (blue collar) area then probably just do a spruce up.
Sam recommends most of the time just do the spruce up.
So, get the opinion from 3 selling agents, price up the reno against what they think each one could sell for.
Sam when buying a shit property will get it to liveable condition, rent it out then 2-3 years when it’s time to sell he’ll do a high spec reno and sell it for top dollar as the market loves high spec reno for where it is.
Sam likes to do runners with early market B&B’s. Runners are great as the % return over the course of 3 years might be lower i.e., 50% vs 120% that’s still significant. Say you buy a place for 500k and 3 years later it’s 750k and you sell it then you can get all that cash and debt back and roll into more deals
Questions for PMs
Ask who your actual PM will be?
How long have they been in the business for?
How many properties do they manage?
How much support do they have?
An example for trust structures
Lets say you have 1.5 million borrowing capacity in your personal name and only 1 million in trust
How you need to look at it is you can do 1 million in every single trust so once you reach the end of the second trust you have purchased properties equally to 2 million debt and you can go again in the third
So, with that outlook that’s why trusts are so much better as you’re borrowing capacity stretches, it doesn’t increase it.
Remember you may not need as many B&B’s at the higher price point compared to Sam’s School of Property examples e.g., 12:8 ratio could be just 8:8 ratio.
First tier lenders let you val every 45 days, second tier lenders allow you to do it every 90 days
For CF deals when APS sends you a CF deal with a spreadsheet drop the LVR to 20% or 0% to see how much it’s going to earn you on the backend
[August 2024] School of Property Q&A
Someone's situation is 450k borrowing capacity and 300k cash, Sam said to go into trust structures straight away to preserve the borrowing capacity. He’d go with a CF deal first and continue building income in personal name to improve serviceability. Then move into a second trust structure with another CF deal. This will be a lot slower process as there’s no B&B’s as you want to put in 2 properties per trust.
A new trustee for each trust. For every trust should have it’s own trustee and new lender so you can ring fence the debt.
Sam suggests paying a b&p (terminate inspector) to do it yearly or thereabouts if in a termite prone area. Potentially also ask the professional how often they should do it because terminate barriers usually last 8 years.
Use a different bank account for each trust to isolate the ingoings and outgoings.
Example of CGT:
Say you bought property at 500k in personal/trust now you sell at 900k after 12 months
You made 400k
200k of that is CGT exempt (personal/trust has 50% CGT exempt, company does not)
Remaining 200k is added to your taxable income and calculated accordingly
Be strategic with selling property when your partner is having 6-12 months off etc. for a baby. If the property is in a trust structure you can distribute the profits to the partner not working and sometimes save 50-60k.
For SMSF we want the biggest return possible as quickly as possible so aim for a running market within the next 3 years it will do 60-80%. We want low maintenance. Need more outlay for SMSF as you want something established and nice.
What items get added or deducted to the cost base of property when selling?
Buyers agency fee isn’t tax deductible when you buy it gets added to your cost base.
Everything you pay on the way in
Stamp duty
Legals
BA fees
Extensive renovations
So, say you bought it for 500k and then the items above cost 50k then your total is 550k and you sell it for 900k your profit is 350k and 50% of that is CGT exempt.
When you get to the backend you want 2 B&B’s and 2 CF’s in 1 trust with the CF’s in separate states to reduce the exposure to land tax as there’s the 300k land value threshold roughly depending on state. Commercial CF land tax is covered by tenants.
Buy property separately in your personal name to reduce land tax. I think trust is okay…
For self declaring:
If you self declare in trust 1 then buy property in trust 2 then you self declare in trust 2 then refinance in trust 2 with a lender that doesn’t need a self declaration, maybe a mainstream. Give money back to yourself then move into trust 3. This works as long as you have the equity.
[September 2024] School of Property Q&A
Factor in growth for trading profitably for the green tick from accountant
Get low doc lending and put in offset to make it positive to keep moving forward
Move money from personal into trust 1 get the tick then move from trust 1 back to personal then into trust 2
Don’t sell when there’s a long lease left
In trusts your borrowing capacity is little bit less than personal as in personal they add 10% as they take into account negative gearing. So, if you have 1 million in personal you probably have 900k in trusts.
Resi capital is 7% gross and 5% net - resi regional is 8% gross and 6% net - commercial is 7% net
In 12 months we will see a lot of rate cuts and people within that timeframe will be searching for a lot of CF deals
Timeframe of turning around when submitting loan docs to brokers is 24 business days roughly. Depending on complexity 1/2/3 weeks max.
Should always be bringing in tangible numbers to strategy call else it’s useless
Books closed for foundational deals sub 450k
Bare minimum for trusts is B&B with high yield at a 500k purchase price to keep things as close to neutral as possible. B&B might not be trading profitably initially but within the next 6-12 months as interest rates drop they should. Also, could buy an established CF property.
First phase of accusation is always the hardest - when you sell a deal is usually the end of the first phase - sometimes you might need to sit on the sideline for 6-12 months if you can’t do anything until you sell a property but that property is in a market with 6-12 months until the peak
Keeps everything interest only even if it’s a CF property but as you get further on in your journey you could swap them to P&I
SMSF aim for 150k deposit with 450-550k purchase price
SMSF servicing is based on income within SMSF and contributions. Say, if individual 1 makes 1 million a year and contributes $30k and individual 2 makes 100k a year and contributes $30k a year they get the same borrowing capacity
Sam runs his trust structure by doing a company above a discretionary trust, which he says is a corporate structure
[October 2024] School of Property Q&A
Minimum they’re taking on is 400k trademark and 450k will get you something better
Hack Sam uses is buy the property at 80% LVR fix the interest rate on the 80% component and if you still want to or need to access the extra 8% you can have that fixed amount then access the extra bit. You’ll pay the higher interest on the additional equity release say 8% (80 to 88) allows you to lock the bulk of the loan at the lower interest rate.
When you first open the trust a lender might like to know if you’re trading a business out of it. It's an unusual request for a bank to want a letter from an account after a new trust has been setup.
An accountant will sometimes write you a letter if trust 1 is trading 20k positive and trust 2 10k negative they will look at both together and say it’s positive instead of usually just looking individually
They dropped from 12-13 locations to just 5 or 6 so sourcing has increased
Sam does bank account per trust not bank account per property
Sam will organise 3 trusts before hand and 3 bank accounts for each trust before sourcing property
If you’re looking to travel for 12 months time it in the future after you’ve first purchased a few B&B’s then sell your biggest performer at the peak and sit that in your offset as a buffer to hold your portfolio whilst you’re away
Issue with gifting into a trust is at some point when you have to pay it back you have to distribute it out and pay a profit/tax on it. Whereas if you loan it to the trust from yourself and then get it paid back by selling it as it gets released from the backend from a sale. You can then repay the debt, repay the loan and transfer it back. You don’t have to put a figure on the loan amount; you can lend the money at 0% interest rate.
Sam would leave amount buffer in offset that you feel like meets your risk appetite
If you’re going to do an equity release for personal items then make sure to keep it separate for investment purposes
Sam is basically buying everything in the 500k range
If the property you’re buying is going to be significantly negatively geared and you can only do 1 in a trust that it’s potentially better to do it in your personal name as you have access to negative gearing tax benefits and potentially can then buy more properties.
Sam buys 4 times a year and that’s it. He gets pre approvals twice a year, say January and July. Then in April and October he does equity releases. He gets 5-6 pre approvals at a time and they typically expire.
If you want to do 10 properties a year do 2-3 a quarter as they go to settle get the broker to get the next lot of pre approvals going.
Some banks make it a legal requirement to obtain legal advice when borrowing within a trust.
Ask broker ahead of time if this trust/borrowing requires legal advice sign off
Dude has pre approvals for 370k and 80k in the bank is this enough?
It is enough if you’re already signed on it will just will take a little while
A new corporation for each new trust
Anon Tron Company 1 - Trust 1
Anon Tron Company 2 - Trust 2
Usually you would pull equity out of trust until it’s minimum 10k a year positive to cover 10k a year expenses? I think…
Average Australian income usually max out and slow down around property 3 and 4 and then need to sell property 1
Do SMSF with interest only and 88%/90% LVR to scale faster and more aggressive
If you just renovated a place and can’t sell as the market isn’t great then when putting on market for rent put it at $450 instead of $500 a week and select the best tenant with amazing references after 6-12 months try to sell and it should still look brand new as the tenant should be really good.
Every month Sam would put down and look at all the bills and get everything else sent to the PM. He would check all PM statements to check no one was trying to pull the wool over his eyes. When something was paid he would put it into a folder. Then you get your annual statements and put it all in one spot.
Just be careful as the PM could be shady about “sending out a handyman that needed to do work” and invoice you each month for it for like $200
If you get a depreciation schedule then renovate it an accountant should be able to do the top up depreciation of the renovation amount if you hand them all the receipts.
Sam has been rentvesting since 27 and lived in his own PPOR from 19 to 27 (8 years). Rentvested for 7 years and has moved 5 times during that time. He moved each time due to trying out different areas. Every place offered to extend the lease for 12 more months.
You can get pre approval based on the contract sale price of your property you don’t need to wait until it’s settled
Sam would suggest moving into trust straight away if you have 600k max borrowing
Don’t sign people on for 2 year lease you don’t know what’s going to happen
[November 2024] School of Property Q&A
500-700k commercial deals
For commercial properties only really run net yields
As everything owners usually pay in resi deals are covered in commercials like land tax etc.
Remember you can do a letter of declaration yourself to move into the next trust then later go back when it is actually trading profitably and get a letter from the accountant to go with a better lender.
Remember ideally you want 2 B&B and 1 CF per trust
Sam recommends getting your pre-approval and getting onto the source list but still need to save X amount if you think you can save X amount in 8-10 weeks then jump onto the source list
Can only get multiple pre-approvals at once for 1 trust at a time with the same lender.
See how often a lender can value a property, some 1st tier are 45 days and others are 90 days. Ask as frequently as you can but just outside the 45/90 days.
New company for each trust
Group text strategist and client success person for next deal
If you ring fence a trust it should allow you to get that pre approval and source the deal. The accountant letter will only last 30-90 days and will expire after each purchase/pre approvals. Unless you get multiple pre approvals at once.
1 inspection per week for trades to assess work in contract. Get all quotes together and approved for the day after settlement so it’s all good to go with trades heading in.
Some locations in Australia can be difficult to lease out during Dec/Jan if it’s a transient market so rent will drop during this time. Could be uni students, nurses etc. So, in this time frame be realistic with your rent otherwise you could have a 6-8 week vacancy.
Move it quickly, take the pay cut people will take $550 over $600 if it ticks all of their boxes during Dec/Jan
Sam at the start of each year will pull out say 40k of equity from property and sit it into the offset to use debt to service debt.
LOOK UP HOW TO USE DEBT TO SERVICE DEBT
Jack Williams is that brokers name
Can do personal letter of declaration trust is trading profitably. Only 2 lenders accept this at the moment.
Can have multiple people in SMSF

[February 2025] School of Property Q&A
Work around for commercial and resi… have separate trust for commercial and resi, don’t put together.
APS accountant happy to run with this
2 resi B&B in trust 1 10k negative
1 commercial in trust 2 5-10k positive
Accountant is happy to sign off as if they were both in the same trust
Even if the commercial is 5k positive and resi is 10k negative, accountants can and are happy to sign off. And include capital growth as a positive net position.
APS brokers also happy with it
Self declare lenders also happy with this approach
Sub 400 and 450k markets popping up but sub 500k long wait times
Sub 600k is 8 week turn around
Look at what banks to go through for each trust strategy example:
Trust 1 for equity release
Trust 2 for self declare
Commercial 500-700k but recommended 1 to 2 million
If loan is 500k cash from parents recommend:
Go straight into trust
Low income earner
4 properties 80% LVR but CF might not be great
2 B&B and do a commercial
Let it sit there for 6 months and see where to go from there
Better commercial assets at 1-2 million vs 500-900k
Most banks give you straight equity release cash into bank but some want to see an appreciating asset tied to it
Brokers charging for pre-approvals comes about usually from equity releases
Broker is doing same amount of work for 50k equity release and 500k loan
Clawback period for brokers is 18-24 months so if you were to refinance within that period they lose it
Rates going down means more people flooding into market and pre-approvals will take longer
Sam will offload 15-20 properties over the next 12-18 months that was done in Perth and Brisbane
He knows dumb money first home buyers flooding into market will pay big money
He’s letting leasers roll into month to month (illegal in QLD to be month to month, can 3 or 6 months)
He’ll look to potentially offload end of this year or early next year
Sam built everything on equity as he was low income earner
Used it to pay legal fees, renovations etc.
In current market…
500-550k will be negative right now buy in trust 1 that has best equity release to roll into trust 2 and 3 that allow you to self declare
You can reach out to APS team during sourcing just make sure you’re polite and know the guys you’re asking the questions to aren’t the ones sourcing the deal
Process for exiting markets if APS believes that a market has had it’s growth run?
Story of LGA in Perth where investors pumped and dumped but now owner occ and first home buyers coming in and this LGA will grow again over 12 months
If you don’t need to sell then don’t sell
Aim for 1 commercial ($1 million) with 2 B&B ($500k each)
APS aims for 50% target in 2 years in running market
Client story:
$700k deposit Sam says
Option 1 - Do 1 commercial in trust 1 and 3 resi in trust 2
Trust 1 - Commercial $1.5 million (20% deposit + closings $350k in)
Remaining $350k for 3 resi’s in trust
Option 2
Trust 1 - 2 resi’s and use equity release or remaining cash for Trust 2
Trust 2 (Self Declare Trust) - 2 resi’s
Trust 3 (Self Declare Trust) - 2 resi’s
Trust 4 (Trust company structure) - 1 commercial using equity release from Trust 1-3
Load up on growth properties first then put commercial at end it’s better than commercial at front
Sam is seeing 6-7% net yields in current markets
For strategy session with APS come prepared spreadsheet with:
Lease terms
Current rent
Current valuation (get bank val before meeting)
Gives them an idea of servicing
Sam recommends not building anymore as it takes you out of the market for too long
Speed at over $550k right now to $650k is a lot faster than sub $500k
Lenders look at 5% liquidity in super account of purchase price
Best time to do equity release is as soon as you can
If you can’t do anything until you do sell then sell, else, watch and see interest rate and prices
Self declare is self declare, if it’s 10k a year negative you can self declare but potential ask your strategist
If you have 20k HECS that impacts borrowing capacity by 100k if you remove it then you have 100k borrowing capacity per trust. At same time you don’t need to pay off HECS if it isn’t holding you back.
Running market better than an up and comer as it helps build foundation quicker
Aim for 120-150k in super before buying
If you have 1.2 million borrowing capacity in trust go for 2 B&B and leave 200k borrowing capacity in the trust and just strip the equity
No locations at current interest rates at 88% LVR B&B will trade profitably at 500k
Might need to wait 6-12 months for them to trade profitably
Leave those lenders that let you self declare so you can self declare in a couple of trusts
Sam says in current markets and current interest rates go through trust straight away, property 1
Sam thinks at the moment there aren’t any runner markets most markets are 3-5 years away from selling
Careful for a selling agent saying list now there will be a ton coming to market next month etc. etc. careful. Need to articulate your questions to the selling agent carefully, if you say you might want to renovate they might say no not good as they know it will be a bit of time to renovate, they want to sell it now.
80% markets APS active in are commercial and will manage it
[March 2025] School of Property Q&A
APS supports 300-400k markets at the moment with villas, units etc.
Right now 550-600k is normal resi price with 120k cash to get into it
Right now typical out of pocket is $150-$300 per week with resi B&B. Normal at the start of a portfolio acquisition phase. But as you build a bigger portfolio you will use debt to service debt. So you calculate at the start of the year how much negative cash flow you’ll be ahead of time and sit it there to be eaten up by interests over the course of the year.
2-3 lenders allowing you to do self declarations
Ask the broker how much borrowing you have that chop that into multiple pre approvals.
Easier for 600k to get to 1 million as the percent increase is less than 400k to 800k
Reason why 600k is good is it’s an area where affordability is double say Perth that went from 200k to 600k now Perth is a stressed market. Therefore, this new market to go from 600k to 1 million is a lot easier than Perth doing it.
Cannot get offset account in Trust only redraw and really hard to get cash out
Bank account for a trust, could have multiple properties for the same account. Sam recommends once a month check in top up account back to $X amount.
Sam buys individual insurance policies. If a number of insurance claims are made in an area, premiums within that area go up. Sam insures with Terri Schere with the building and landlord. If you make a claim with Terri your premium doesn’t automatically go up, it’s based on postcode quantity of claims vs individual.
For commercial lending lenders want to know what asset class your chasing and roughly what area. Pre approval/letter of confidence relative to that. Lenders have risk ratings based on different postcodes with different asset types. I.e., some areas might have industrial as really low in one area but really high in another based on demand.
Need specific brokers with resident vs commercial as it’s completely different.
Ask APS strategy call if Aaron is a good broker for commercial?
If you’re sitting on the fence because you're waiting for quotes for certain B&P it’s best to crash the deal. If APS can’t get the price lowered then it’s on you whether or not to crash the deal.
Need 150k for SMSF. You are supposed to pay for everything out of SMSF but can be creative with ways to pay in personal.
Reach out to APS they use an ASX company to setup the SMSF and financial advice.
You can equity release out of commercial but it’s typically a lot harder. Commercial valuations significantly more expensive. ONLY IF you REALLY REALLY need the cash then do it to scale your growth portfolio.
Sams client has household income less than 200k with lots of bread and butters, equity farming. In current interest rate environment doing 100% lend with bread and butter you’re $10k negative a year, some might be lower and some might be higher.
Instead of $700k deal that’s costing you $15k a year negative do a 75-80% LVR commercial at $5-10k a year positive.
You’re going to need them in your portfolio eventually anyway as the final play. And after banking a few growth properties at $10k a year negative you need this commercial to balance out.
E.g., if you have 8 growth properties in your portfolio at $80k a year negative and you can’t sell anything for at least 6 months that’s a massive deficit. If you were a PAYG earner and are running $80k a year negative and you do a PAYG variation you’re probably getting $30k back
But this 4 property portfolio rose by $546k that was costing them $32k a year at 100% lending. That’s 8% cost on what they made that year.
If you want to have a good year and go hard equity release say $60-$80k if that’s how much the portfolio is going to cost for the next 12 months to be eaten up by interest repayments as negative cashflow. Or do a PAYG variation where it will cost $40-$50k a year to hold after that. Release that $50k to purely be eaten up by the interest component.
Once you get those growth properties you sell them, cash them out, then get the commercial properties. Maybe you get 600-800k in cash and you get a 1.5-2 million commercial and pair it with more bread and butters.
But it’s about releasing debt to service debt.
Commercial
Blue chip; medical, industrial. Is low risk, low yield, around 5.5-6% yield.
Other assets, higher risk, higher yield, 7%-7%+ yield.
$800k, $1 million, $2 million roughly all similar asset classes
It’s relative to the lease terms etc.
APS confident of 6% yield low risk.
Biggest issue with commercial and lending within the same trust as resi they impact each other
Need to go in with at least 35% deposit plus closings if you don’t want it to impact
Have them in a side entity and structure, chat with accountant about getting it setup properly
If you have 2-3 B&B’s in trust 1 running $20k negative and in trust 2 or company 2 however the accountant sets it up and is running $20k positive they are taking care of themselves.
Commercial
What are the expected non funding buffers?
Residential has council, water, insurance
APS work off true net lease meaning land tax, council rates, insurance, maintenance are all covered for by the tenants
Other things are gross leases which might be 9-10%
Examples at 6-7% are true net lease
APS calculates all the items to take the gross lease to true net lease for you
APS have extremely expensive subscriptions to get all this data and details
It’s so hard to calculate these things as a novice investor
Q: Pull out as much equity as you can i.e., up to 80% LVR or some situations to do a partial equity release to not cut into borrowing capacity
A: What debt is in your personal name? If you have a million dollars equity in your personal name you can access but you only had 500k borrowing in trust structures. Just because you have the equity there doesn’t mean you want to pull it out. As if you pull out 500k, well I’ve got the ability to pull out a million to take me up to 80% LVR or pull out 500k might take me up to 50, 60 or 70% LVR. It doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do as it will eat into the borrowing capacity of the trust.
When it comes to trusts you want to farm them and access as much as you can per trust from borrowing and equity release. Need to be careful when it’s in your personal name. Every dollar you pull out in your personal name has a significant impact on your trusts.
Q: 1.5 million commercial with 70% LVR better in personal name vs. trust to boost income to boost servicing
A: Don’t put commercial in personal name OR cash flow deal
Can wash through trust and distribute to oneself and that will boost servicing
It might be extra $20-30k but the lenders do some shaving based on where that income came from (rent)
You can rent a property back to yourself within a trust. Speak to the accountant and broker. Can ring fence debt and pay yourself more than market rent to make it look better.
You can write off the LMI and buyer agent fee.
When selling property
Go to real estate and click find agent
Pick top 3 or 5 from list in your suburb and give them call and ask how much they think they can sell property for (more details from the bootcamp look there)
Look at recently sold, find the worst, average and best and compare to your property. Find 3-5 properties that are genuinely close to yours.
Don’t declare trust is trading profitably then put the new property into that same trust
If you move trusts I think you need to move to a new lender as well.. Ask?
Sweet spot for commercial is $1-3 million
If a $1 million commercial…
75%-80% LVR
You need $200-$250k deposit plus closings
BA Fee
Stamp duty
If you have $200k deposit then $250k
If you have $250k deposit you need $300k for closings
So the closings for $550-$600k resi properties is similar to $1 million commercial
People with $1 million deposit but do $600-700k into resi and $300-400k into commercial
Some people who are retired or not working for a year will come in for a lease doc loan, 2 lenders do it, one at 65% LVR and 70% LVR. So, $350k deposit plus closings or $300k deposit plus closings ($50k closings).
At the moment March 2025, ability to buy up to $550k and have cash of $110-120k
Sam still thinks there’s lots of juice left in the tank for Townsville
You want to build the biggest equity base possible so eventually when you get stuck you can go through a sell down say 2 properties and purchase a $2-3 million commercial deal that gives you $70k net passive. And now all the trusts across the portfolio are trading profitably.
Make sure all your ingoings and outgoings come out of one bank account for that trust and all properties within it
[April 2025] School of Property Q&A
4 trusts (2 self declare, 2 non self declare)
Take profits from personal sale property and put into trust 5 lease doc loan if you’re waiting for B&B’s in first 4 trusts to mature. You can then use the surplus cash from this trust and wipe across the negative cashflow across the other 4 trusts.
Otherwise, lenders in the 2 trusts non self declared will be looking at this debt.
Load up B&B’s before giving up POYG job
One bank account per trust (2 properties in 1 trust, 1 bank account).
LMI changes come in for trust structures, 2 deals at 80% LVR as opposed to 3 deals at 88% LVR. Easier to get equity out sooner. Avoid LMI, interest rate lower. Not ideal but it’s okay.
2 at the moment with APS, but maybe the end of year could be 4. Must be the same lender for the pre-approvals.
Managing negative cash flow, end of each year forecast negative cash flow and when doing equity strip or refinance pull out the amount and sit in offset.
$1 million entry price for commercial
$1.5-$2 million better commercial

[May 2025] School of Property Q&A
$520k purchase, 80% LVR, pre-approval loan amount is probably $430k
Aim is 2 per trust not 1
Look at audit insurance once reach 5-10 properties, it covers if ATO wants to audit you and costs you need to pay accountant to do the audit
Banks strongly recommend independent legal advice. Sam has waived legal advice many times, can get commercial lawyers to look at docs for an hour, some lenders require it. Sam’s dude is $250 an hour. He took 12 docs to him all at once from cash outs, restructures etc., took an hour. Might need to call 10-20 lawyers to get this price.
SMSF Sam recommends a $20k buffer for a property, and I guess $5-$10k per property after that. He also recommends you can do a deal with $100k.
Current market with $320k cash deposit, 80% LVR, $650k purchase price per property. Could maybe push for 88% LVR.
Commercials can do $800-$1 million for a good one. 65% lease doc, $400k at $1 million. Ask the broker if there are any lenders at 70-75% LVR if you don’t have that money and need a cash flow.
Last preapproval submitted to $550k was rejected from APS. They said they needed $700k. Depends on when you submitted it and if you’re an existing client or not. Can be added to the list at the higher amount whilst submitting to the broker. Can source a lot sooner at $650k-$700k with a better quality asset.
Buying pools for up to $600k is very limited. Good markets $650-700k.
Use up non-self-declared lenders as much as possible before moving to self-declare, apparently currently there’s only 2 self-declare lenders.
1-2 properties per trust and 2-3 trusts before moving to self-declare which means might get property 6-8 in self-declare or property 8-10 in self-declare
Won’t see much of a change in cashflow position until doing a sell down, took Sam 8 years.
Early years going to be more negative
Try to isolate debt
Avoid debt in personal name
Scenario,
2 prop in personal name,
look to buy 1 prop per trust,
would sell 1 prop in personal name to get 2 properties in trust (trust 1 & trust 2)
Then would need to release equity in prop 2 in personal name to get into trust 3
Instead sold prop 2 in personal name
Now can do 6 prop total, 2 prop per trust
Pepper and Firstmac are second tier - and Liberty and latrobe and third tier
Sam says don’t worry about refinancing on growth properties, just sell them
He says for cashflow deals you could refinance to better lender once doing some sell downs
This is due to cost
Just think about how to get the next deal and how can I afford that instead of the interest rate being higher on loans and missing deals
Increase overall loan amount to include the APS fee into the settlement - need to chat to broker - does it make a difference? Confused.
450k in Australia right now doesn’t get you much…
Get PPOR up to 800k to utilise first home buyers scheme, live in 12 months and hope you can release equity… depends on location as well
130-180k deposit minimum at 90% LVR for SMSF
Don’t hold resi properties within same trust as commercial
Sam has 4 resi props per trust and then commercial into separate trust
Can still wash commercial cashflow through other trusts
Sam has some resi’s in same trust as commercial but plans to sell those resi’s in next 6-12 months
To do 60k per annum net passive
Go straight into trust
3 deals in trusts
Go through growth cycles
Sell off first deal - prob have 300-400k capital from that deal
Use that capital to pay commercial deal for 1-1.2 million
As next 2 go through growth cycles sell them off to pay down debt on commercial
This commercial at 6% NET return at 1 million will be 60k per year and at 1.2 million will be 72k per year net passive
Trust 1 mainstream lender, we have 2 non conforming lenders allowing you to do self declaration
You just need enough to deal 1 in trust 1 then self declaration for trust 2 and 3 and use refinancing

Could parents do 1-1.5 million commercial on 65% lease doc loan with their super? That would net them more per year than interest? Use 500k to fund this. This is 60-90k NET. Could be 90-100k NET.
In SMSF get 2 prop, sell them, net 800k, put 500k into commercial, put 300k into 2 more deals, sell them down, pay off the rest of debt on commercial deal.
This can be done in less than 10 years.

[June 2025] School of Property Q&A
Diversify commercials across states and asset types to help against recession and economic downturn
Asset class
Office
Retail
Industrial
Small shopping centres
2 deals blue chip being industrial, slightly lower yields 5.5-6% net but are reliable
1 deal higher yield property but higher risk as well 6.5-7% net
Aim for things required forever i.e., medical centre
Riskier just being potential longer vacancy period compared to others
Also when wanting 250k net passive per year aim for 300k net passive as a buffer for re-leasing etc.
If you had 10 property portfolio that pays out 250k net profit post tax that will pay out 2.5 million commercial portfolio
Sam believes in carrying debt forward, so get 3 million commercial asset and get 500k debt
Same cashflow but significantly higher return, interest only for 5 years and then roll over and repeat it and you can sell down more resi properties
In 2 years Sam doesn’t think there will be any opportunities besides commercial for cashflow. If rates come down then maybe resi then.
Sam says get to 6-8 properties, do a sell down of 2 of them, then might be right time to do a commercial
Sam doesn’t like to build the commercial all at the back end, he likes to do on the way through
Sam says if a trust is trading 10k negative a year you can’t just put in 10k of your own cash and say it’s trading neutral. You have to put cash into the offset and show to the accountant over the course of a year it will trade neutral based on the lower loan amount.
Insurance policy; fixed value vs replacement value
Replacement cover $1,000 cheaper
Sam prefers fixed value so he can set the amount
But a lot of his properties are old shitty 3bd 1bth fibro shack, so he doesn’t want replacement value on that
He wants a really nice fixed value where it might be $100-$200 more but the pay out is $200,000 more
If a cyclone comes through and you have to replace it either you can build a really (fixed value) nice house or (replacement) bulldoze the house and sell the block as is and take the insurance payout
Sam Q1 each year will strip enough equity to service the debt for the next 12 months and then rinse and repeat. Reset his goals in the new year and strip equity.
Sam puts all bills etc. to the PM to take care of
Sam doesn’t have any loans with mainstream lenders. He uses lower tier lenders and ringfences.
Sam says when selling property it depends on some things
Some locations are dead from November-January (transient markets)
Some markets are better in winter vs spring depending on buyer demand and how many people are selling. Less buyers and less competition in winter, if there’s not much on the market and there’s a few buyers then winter is better. Else, spring is better.
To track stock
Jump on SQM research, put in your postcode, can see stock going up or down
To see what stock levels are doing, if they are trending down then stock is tightening and means the market is going to grow.
If it’s trending up that you’re in a softening market and will be hard to sell
Don’t do depreciation schedule in SMSF as it’s aim is a clean home, low maintenance
When you get a depreciation schedule is when you go to sell it you have to add that back
Because you’re going to be selling them, and lower tax bracket etc.
For commercial to get in, say 1 million commercial you need a 250k deposit. You sell 1 B&B to get in (clearing 250k net profit after tax). Then say you sell 2 more B&B to get the 750k debt down to 250k debt.
Sam would personally leave it at 25% LVR and let that debt get eaten away from inflation instead of clearing the debt and put that 250k difference into another commercial or B&B
Townsville, from July 1st it will be interesting to see what buyers might do with buyer fatigue easing and grants and incentives… Townsville might have another kick. It’s going to be a watch, wait and see.
10 areas in QLD that have 50,000+ populations, some are 80-200k+. With those areas there are some that might get kicked initially into the investor driven market but because they are regional, and the income of locals, Mackay, Townsville, Rockhampton, they have resources dependent on the area. Owner occupier demand comes in then they fight against investors, OO pulls out, investors push up, OO notice it’s still running they jump back in and then compete against each other, and then the aim is to sell at that point whilst other buyers agents are still buying. Also, it depends on how much growth is left in the tank, has it moved 100% or 200%? Depends what’s driving an area
Must keep finger on pulse, speak to agents
Or speak to APS
If a heap of growth happens but big projects come into an area the construction workers enter area, frenzy buying beforehand there will also be demand on the rental market will turn local renters into buyers.
How much of a reno should we be looking at for our first deal? Depends on time, skillset and how much you make. Sam recommends if you make less than $150k a year then do the reno yourself, cosmetic reno, couple of weeks. Paint, floor, landscaping, fixtures, fitting, then kitchen then bathroom. Bathroom don’t do yourself for the first one. Do cosmetic for the first one, not full blown reno. Everyone gets the first renovation wrong.
APS client took 4 months to a renovation, he thought 4 weeks.
Can build 5-6 properties without too many limitations with servicing providing using right broker
Once you get there, potentially looking to sell property 1 and/or 2 to fund a commercial, and equity strip existing resi deals to be able to keep moving forward
Back in the day Sam didn’t have lenders that supported letters of declaration, would take 12-18 months to get granny built, whereas with commercial it’s pretty much instant
Sam actually recommends doing a $700k deal and $450k deal instead of 2 at $600k…
But Paul strategist recommended 2 at $600k… I wonder why
Must keep in mind that yes batches of B&B in SMSF will increase each cycle say $500k now, next $650k, the idea is the goal is to acquire a $2 million commercial deal. Commercial properties don’t increase as much as B&B’s. If each cycle we can bank $250k per deal, per sell down, that’s 8-10 deals to fully pay out the commercial, and could be less.
For painting a property, ask the PM if it can get through another tenancy before needing it or if it requires it now.
Keep extra money against offset in trust to be able to keep it trading profitably. Put it against P&I loans first, then highest interest next.
3 to 1 ratio B&B to commercial
APS records minimum 50-100% growth rate in 2-4 year period
That is 14% growth per year to break even on $100k cost taking into account BA fees, agent fees, losses etc.
Sam says first 2 properties mainstream, then next 2 in self declare, let first 2 mature and sell, then maybe move into commercial or B&B for 1 then commercial
If you're stuck, you need to weigh up selling it how many more properties you can buy vs. holding and let the property grow more if there’s more growth to go.
Walking into a house with fresh paint and carpet is going to smell amazing. If you’re between tenants and want to increase the value for equity release and will be a physical inspection then yes a $10-15k cosmetic renovation is a great idea.

[July 2025] School of Property Q&A
50% can write off school of property
Can also write off bootcamp/summit as long as you owned an investment property before hand
I took out an equity loan against my PPOR and moved it into a trust to buy an investment property. If I claim the interest cost on tax from the equity loan against my PPOR it won’t allow the trust to trade profitably. Do you know anyways around being able to have the tax deduction and let the trust trade profitably?
Chat to the accountant to see how much you can charge to allow it to still trade profitably.
We could also potentially defer the interest over a year or two before needing to be paid back? There’s no set requirement as to when it should be repaid. Could potentially wait a couple years before needing to pay back.
Sam wouldn’t charge himself back the interest component if it stops him from moving forward. He will just wear the cost of $20,000 for example the interest cost.
Excess $1,000 and claim is $3,000 Sam wouldn’t do it. Doesn’t want mark again name, Terri doesn’t currently hit you with no claim bonus, it goes against suburb. Claim when it’s relevant and extensive. Sam didn’t make any insurance claims until last 12-18 months as the little stuff $1/2/3k claims he would quickly turn it around outside insurance. Weigh it up with common sense.
Don’t know if an insurance provider will change their policy thinking it’s on postcode vs. making claims
Insurance claim is lengthy process
Commercial, most banks in commercial will give you preapproval. They give an estimated yield they require based on the asset type you give them. Or might give approval in principal which isn’t exact pre approval. Might be 1-1.2million purchase based on X yield, asset type, net return and LVR.
Lease doc loans, 65-70% LVR with 2 mainstream lenders, 1% lower than average interest rate compared to resi. Goes off lease to repay.
Can do full doc or lease doc, lease doc is more capital intensive.
APS have 50% of their deals going through lease doc
Nothing in Australia that Sam would put $300k into, but there is stuff at the $350k mark.
Sam isn’t worried about potential CGT change
Sam suggests every year to check building cost and premiums. Make sure it’s will insured.
Terri Scheer aren’t an auto renew
AAMI Insurance has auto renew and will do 20-30% jump so be careful
Sam will be bringing a different strategy to mentoring this year, lower -> higher cost. But he does say that all APS strategists and brokers have a big portfolio.
Buying property in a trust and renting to yourself.
Sam suggests get a valuation done before partner or friend moves in to rent it. If it’s immediately after purchase there’s nothing you can do to challenge the valuation. But if you do some touch ups/renovations and get a sales agent to appraise it to get the highest valuation done possible before renting out will reduce your CGT.

Case study: Mother is 60 years old and plans to work until retirement age on $70k a year salary
PPOR worth $1.4 million, 12% LVR
IP worth $550k, 60% LVR
$380k super
What’s the best game plan over the next 7 years?
If she owned a $2 million commercial property at 5-6-7% net return that would be $100-120-140k per annum
$1.5 million commercial at 6% net return would be $100k per annum
Sam would roll that $380k in super into 2 bread and butters with 5-7 year timeframe. $160k per deal with $60k left over.
Each B&B is $500-600k each, they net out $800-900-$1million, $500-$700k profit in super. Could buy quite a low debt level commercial, $1 - $1.5 million, 6.5% return.
Would get $50-$70k when taking into account debt.
That’s basically 3 properties (2 resi and 1 commercial) over the next 5-7 years.
Now what about outside of super…
Sell IP out of personal name and roll into trusts. Would net $200-250k and use equity from PPOR to buy 2 properties. Let that grow over next 2-5 years. Would net more than a million dollars of these 2 combined with super properties.
If you net 1.5 million and buy a 2 million commercial asset at 25% LVR with $500k debt at 6% net return. That’s $120k rental income, minus $30k for interest, you’ve got $90k net return.
Tinder for commercial syndicate above $5 million with APS (email them)
Send them purchasing power, under $2 million is mum and dad investor zone
They’ve been looking at doing syndication of $10-$20 million+ with unit structure
Not too many people who have purchasing power for $5 million+ but there’s deals there
Example, 2 bread and butter and 1 commercial next year or 1 bread and butter and 1 commercial this year, 350k capital available.
Wouldn’t split 350k into 1 bread and butter and 1 commercial asset.
150k for bread and butter, and 200k for commercial isn’t enough.
350k is not too bad for a commercial deal.
So, question is do we do a commercial deal now or 2 bread and butters
When you pull equity from property A to purchase property B to you assess that equity release against property A or property B when you assess your numbers
It really goes to property B then it’s 100/105% LVR
If it’s for tax then it’s allocated to property B
Then property B is going to be leveraged with 100/105% with those numbers.
But then it looks like property A is doing really well as it’s not necessarily bringing the debt up on it.
Relating to rent review, Sam will look at comparables and assess, if he has a good tenant and current lease is $450 and market rent is $500. Depends where you are on your journey, if every dollar counts then try and get them up to $500 else, just go up to $480-$490.
Remember the $20 difference is $1,040 a year and the release fee is probably 1.5-2 weeks plus GST so more than $1,000. And doesn’t include vacancy. You might end up $2k net negative.
Talk to Paul about what new markets have popped up asset type and price range
Email in about cashflow spreadsheet if not on SOP
Always use trust from start to retain borrowing capacity
Serviceability buffer is still at 3% and with interest rates at 6% it’s now 9% when they are assessing it
How does the bank assess borrowing power in SMSF?
Based on contributions and cash and rent coming in
Contributions works out servicing
Then rental return based on purchase price and LVR
Doesn’t have anything to do with income, you’re still capped at how much you can put in as contributions
Sam likes to use school of property tracker to make a decision on whether to sell a property or not and assess the portfolio
Sam has seen properties be $200k of valuation sub $1 million
REA isn’t accurate due to offmarket deals that don’t get listed
CoreLogic is also not accurate as takes 4.5-6 months before data makes it there

Rentvesting example 1
PPOR $340k debt, released equity twice $240k for 2 APS deals
$580k combined debt
$40-50k a year which is $800 a week mortgage repayment
House valued $850k think will sell low $900k
$650 a week to rentvest
So, it's a higher net cost to hold, or even if it was like for like or rent is slightly higher. What you need to remember from creative lending is how to stretch that borrowing.
Could run 4 deals per year vs 2 deals per year by selling PPOR and go into rent vesting.
Rentvesting example 2
PPOR $900k value, $660k debt, $850 a week repayments
Looking at settling 4th APS B&B deal, 1 Personal and 3 in 2 separate trusts, total $40-50k a year negative across portfolio.
Struggle with cashflow to hold another B&B, $0 capital left, $150k usable equity in investment portfolio.
What if they sell PPOR and rent for $1,000 a week?
Could try and split out $250-300k capital to go 2 cheaper deals that aren’t as negative, higher yield, more asset in play and use $30-50k to service portfolio next 12 months.
Or get commercial deal, $1-1.5 million, good positive cash flow. And then wait until other B&B’s have run their course and sell them to pick up more.
$50k+ a year negative cashflow is a lot to carry with $250k household income
Rentvesting example 3
$1 million PPOR dream home
$78k chippy
Keen to sell and double down with APS
Wife stay at home mum
No borrowing capacity at the moment
Tricky as already have PPOR as dream home but can’t boost income so might need to sell.
Strategy would be a mix of B&B and cashflow to boost income and serviceability
Lease doc loans in trust structures to purchase commercial assets to help service portfolio and let it take care of itself
From an accounting perspective, to use release equity to fund property deposits?
Example
Drawn $60k from property 1 and $100k equity from property 2
Need to apply these funds as a $90k deposit towards property 5 and $10k deposit towards property 6. Both in separate trusts.
I assume just put them in full against each property to track interests is easier..
Sam says, doesn’t really matter how you set this up. In reality, M and M Trust 1, M Trust 2, it’s all M empire so it all gets washed.
No clean way to do it, what makes the most sense being equity strip out of property 1 twice and might just keep it there for cashflow and tax wise and borrowing wise vs. putting it against new properties.
There’s tax wise and borrowing/lending wise to keep in mind.
Need to just think about what each property needs to trade profitably.
Example about commercial
2 commercial properties and 1 B&B all held in trust
Excess cashflow in trusts totally $70k
$600k in deposits
Next goal is to build enough deposits to purchase $5 million commercial property
Borrowing capacity per trust is $1.4 million
How many B&B’s do we need to buy and mature before we can buy $5 million commercial?
Sam says, depends if want to buy commercial in cash or what LVR?
Split $600k into 4 deposits of $150k per deposit that’s 4 deals at $600k purchase per deal. 2 of those per trust.
Depends what those properties will produce from capital perspective.
Will they return 50-70% in 2 year window, or 70-100% in 5 year window?
2 trusts, 2 properties, 1 runner in each and 1 up and comer in each.
Up and coming, more growth left in tank, but take longer to kick might be 3-5 year play to mature
Runner, is already hot and going might be 50-60% gain in 2-3 years instead of 5
Sell runner after 2 years, nets $250k and roll into 2 more running markets. Then timing of exit of those 2 new runners might line up with the 2 up and comers.
5 year window play properly, 2 runners trade into 2 more runners plus 2 up and comers acquisition of 6 deals in that window, 4-5 year window anticipate $2.5 million - $3 million from $600k to purchase $5 million deal at 30-40% LVR.
Rentvesting
2 deals settled this year and 3rd in works
PPOR value $1.3 million, $300k owing and $400k debt recycled already
Currently weekly repayments $530 but cost $750 per week to rent similar house down the street.
Goal is to pay off the house and $250k net passive income in 10 years time. Should we rentvest?
Sam doesn’t think they are including the $400k debt recycling in the $530 a week in repayments.
Biggest issue Sam sees is borrowing capacity with crazy amount of debt left on PPOR
To pay down the remaining $700k debt on PPOR, in year 5 buy 2 B&B’s that just sit there and sell in year 10 and use profits to pay off debt.
Want to be 100% sure that is the dream PPOR as you waste time getting their sooner which compounds.
Sam thinks goal is very confident in 10 years. Sam thinks if goal is going to change where the actual dream PPOR is $2million then need to sell the current PPOR and use that money put to work.
Random question
Sold property in personal name and now have $200k to redeploy
Broker has said can’t release equity for next B&B under trust due to serviceability issues.
Sam thinks if you clear that much debt out of your personal name he can’t see why you can’t move forward. Thinks broker is wrong.
How do you know how much to insure property for?
Check banks how much loan docs say as they will say how much is required minimum for a rebuild. Sam will go slightly above that.
Can also check in with BA at APS how much rebuild will cost in different areas.
Sam puts in $500k minimum for any area.
If it’s a standard speccy 4 bedroom 2 bathroom and down you should be fine with $500k.
If it’s regional or higher spec build then might need to go higher.
The sooner you acquire a portfolio the more time you have for it to mature and grow. Do 6-10 deals a year vs 2-4 deals a year. Grows a lot more and faster. And can roll into more and more cycles.
Big scenario Rentvesting - 43-50
Middle of buying number 3 this year, number 7 overall and approved for another which will be number 8
Sold all WA deals except for 1 that’s currently on the market. After deal number 8 my available equity will be fully deployed.
WA deal 1 - Sold $220k net profit
WA deal 2 - Sold $145 net profit (trust 1)
Partner’s PPOR bought 2 years ago $435k now worth $700k, current loan $360k with P&I repayments $490 a week. Much cheaper than renting in area which is $750 per week. Which is $12.5k a year difference.
But how much is council rates? $2-3k a year
Insurance? $2k a year
Water rates?
Maintenance
$5-6k a year difference in renting vs owning in same area.
It is P&I but still.
Might be $100k a week extra, which is $5k a year difference
But if you sell PPOR and each deal you buy is $5-10k negative but goes up $50k a year, that’s net $40k+ every deal
And if selling this PPOR gets you 2 deals and then every year after that an extra deal then by the time you’re in year 4 you have another 5 deals in the portfolio. Let’s say they are all producing $40k a year that’s $200k a year in equity.
Loan is only in partners name so doesn’t impact his borrowing. But because she isn’t working full time anymore they can’t do equity release as she can’t service it. Only way to unlock the $300k+ tied up in it would be to sell. Dude says his name would need to go on the contract which would impact his borrowing capacity
Sam is unsure how will kill his serviceability as it will be isolated in trust structures
If eliminating debt on personal name and carrying forward to trust structures unsure how it would be an issue
Cashflow deals
Strategy session with APS speaks to them about serviceability if that’s an issue
Could be presented with slower capital growth potential but significantly stronger yield. Instead of $15k a year negative with strong growth, it’s 5-8$k a year negative.
Which might help you to get into more deals.
Name of game early on is running markets for equity and stripping to get into more deals and wait and let it grow. Then can use cash profits from a sell down to get into more.
Need to be aware if you getting stuck is cashflow or equity
As if we can build $1.5-2 million asset base in growth location, even if we sit out from market for 12 months and let it grow. If it does 20% we just made $300-400k in that time frame.
So, that’s why want high growth asset vs low with better yield to just save on some cash flow.
Equity release
First deal personal name purchase $450k, 13 months passed now val is $640k
Renting for $650 a week
Can pull out equity at 88% LVR $160k or 80% LVR $109k
Pre-approval up to $560k in trust
6 month old baby on maternity leave
40% capital growth, almost $200k up in 13 months on a $450k purchase
If no cash can be extracted to put towards next deal, $109k will struggle to be enough to get into next purchase.
Have a chat to strategist on what deal to source. Could be $500k asset at 88% LVR if you strip out the 80% LVR.
Keep in mind if you bought it at 80% LVR then bring it up to 88% LVR you will be hit with a higher LMI component.
Might not even be able to get a larger deal stripping back 88% LVR to get something for $600k. So might as well save the LMI cost and do 80% LVR and $500k asset at 88% LVR.
Rentvesting
PPOR Brisbane, since 2011, value $1 million, $290k debt in personal name, $200k equity release
Trying to do renovations to sell next year
Looking to move to Bathurst
Himself and partner will have to change jobs so might take themselves out of the market for a little while. Would you recommend getting another deal under the belt before moving? And try to sell to get the capital quicker.
Sam says, if you’re able to release equity out of the property and do another deal in trust and still finish renovations and exit next year then it’s okay. As you will get the debt back anyway.
If you can pull out $200k and buy 2 properties in trust and now you’re done that’s okay as in the transition period you will be selling the PPOR and get all of that back.
Also, double check with APS strategist to see if timelines is on track.
Something
Looking to sell first IP, clearing $200k after all costs and no CGT as PPOR on purchase
Settlement next property with APS B&B in secret location
Once this is done very little money for a deposit on the next
Looking to buy next deal this year
Should selling the property be a viable decision to free up borrowing and profit to keep going or wait 6-9 months and have enough equity and savings from both deals. Current deal in WA and think there’s some more room for growth.
I know I can reach out to my strategist and mortgage broker but wanted to hear from the sensei
Sam thinks that WA location might keep going even though he just sold a property there himself. The grants are coming forward to October so it might go up then.
Sam is happy to sell this bloke the selling agent he used to help sell his property there.
6-9 months turn to 15 months quite quickly when it comes to selling a property so do the following…
Before you sell a place get as many bank vals done as possible, go with the highest for a reval/equity release, then sell the place. As it’s a lengthy process you can deploy that capital into more deals then when you sell the place you can repay that debt essentially. It’s the same as selling first then deploying, you’re just getting access to the capital quicker.
Great Australian dream big blocks…
Southern Perth more desirable to have smaller blocks than larger blocks as it was a large portion of retirement so they want the smaller maintenance and these rented more and better value than the larger blocks
Large blocks don't mean better, if the smaller block rents for the same amount Sam thinks depends on location but the younger generation don’t really care for a backyard as they are out all the time. They want easy maintenance.
Putting PPOR inside corporate trust structure
It is possible, but land tax is expensive, could be $100k in land tax
And also CGT exemption, if it goes from $4 million to $8 million you only need to pay 30% tax on the gain vs the 50%... (Unsure about this, need to double check)
Just remember you need it to trade profitability still…
Sam recommends just buying it in personal name
Holding costs
Scenario, $750k property, $10-12k negative per property at 80% LVR
So, 4 properties that’s $35 to $50k negative across the portfolio
There’s 2 locations they are currently sourcing at that price point, 1 is a runner and another is an up and comer
Need to discuss with the broker and strategist that this is a manageable amount to carry through this timeframe. How quickly you want to scale depends where you go.
Every 24 months you might be exiting a runner market.
Different asset types, classes
After securing those 4 properties at quite negative cash flow you could then exit and go into lower tier market that has higher cash flow
Depends on individual scenario, where the purchase is, LVR, risk, income
Revaluation (reval)
Spreadsheet should have extra tab for last value tab, date and last value and when could be asked for next
Then reminder in phone for 91 days
Need to check with broker and bank to see if it’s 90 days, 190 days or 45 days.
Once you know the valuation timeframe you can put in spreadsheet
Serviceability
Ask broker serviceability to know what to do going forward so you can take it to the strategist
Then tell them if you can’t get the number you will move on to another broker
Sam always says the most important thing for strategy is what is your serviceability in current scenario vs if you sell x or sell y
Broker has a vested interest in keeping you on so they should do this
Scenario
$100k equity to extract from PPOR to get next deal
Borrow over $400k
Spend $60k that has to get a loan to finish renovation on PPOR to sell it to clear the debt? Or, get the second deal and finish the PPOR next year and sell next year?
Sam, get second deal, get that sorted, then get the $60k loan, do the renovations, then sell that
Can’t get the $60k loan if I do the equity release and buy the second deal. Go to the bank of Mum and Dad and says banks are giving you 3% interest on a fixed term deposit, say I’m willing to give you 6% interest or 10% and be able to get the funds and do renovations and clear all the debt.
Structure cash flow
B&B vs manufactured cash flow deal combo for trust structures
Now that manufactured cash flows aren’t viable anymore and B&B’s are now significantly higher purchase price
How do you navigate this without bleeding too much when you really can only get 1 B&B before being tapped out?
Sam says, commercial deal in separate trust but within the same group of entities to wash the profits throughout the negative B&B’s
What can you afford to buy and strip equity out of and still move forward into different trusts?
Remember when you’re starting to build your portfolio it isn’t about cash flow it’s about growth to help build it
Need to get money who we can get money from, once we’ve exhausted those who are able to see everything we then go to the non conforming lenders who take the self declaration letters who will allow us to continue borrowing that money. We keep punching forward like that until we’ve exhausted all those options from a B&B perspective.
We might need to sit like that for a little bit with a 3-5 property portfolio and let that portfolio mature. Will take at least 2 years to mature. We then clear deals that are lower yielding with higher debt on it. And get cash back then we can roll into more B&B’s and/or into a commercial deal. This allows us to trade profitably and then wait a little bit longer for the others to mature to then roll into more B&B’s.
Must carry these through an aggressive borrowing creative lending approach to acquire these assets to build the biggest asset base we can to leverage through the next cycle and phase.
Renovations
Should we spend $30k to make it livable? Or, an $80k to do a full renovation to get a higher val and higher rent?
Sam says, I don’t think a $80k renovation would get you a significant amount more rent. It depends on the cost vs. return doing it. If you spend $50k and it values up by $100k then he would. If you don’t get a $1 for $1 return then he wouldn’t.
He says best to just do the $30k renovation and put the $50k into the next deal. Do cost vs. return with the BA and strategist to help decide.
What will give you the best return? And what makes the most sense to put your investment dollars into?
Borrowing capacity
If your actual expenses are less than the expected expenses in the bracket the lender assesses you against will they go by the actual or the minimum in the bracket?
Sam says, they will go against the minimum in the bracket not your actual even if it’s less
Depreciation schedule
Sam doesn’t get depreciation schedules for a B&B if it is going to sell within 3-5 years and it’s not going to make a huge difference to cashflow.
If it’s going to make a significant difference for you to hold those properties then he recommends.
I.e., 5 B&B and 4 are 1985 builds with some renovations $2-3.5k a year, then 1 that is a 2020 build that you can write off $10-15k on.
Depreciation is just for cash flow as you do need to pay it back when you go to sell it

Positive gearing is post tax time - if was $5k negative and had $5k depreciation
Trust profitable
2 lenders within trust allow letter of self declaration
Sam would swap lenders for the revaluation if he’s at 80% but if it’s 88% LVR then probably not as you lose that top up LMI you already paid
But also at same time it depends on situation, you might want to pay the double LMI to be able to get a good equity release to be able to get into another property
If you don’t sell early November then wait until early February
Don’t ever sell in January
Sam only gets title insurance that he plans to hold long term or might have issue with boundary or unapproved structures or dodgy structure and hold for 3-5 year period minimum
Anything clean, 4 by 2, renovated, no dodgy, he won’t get title insurance as there’s probably not that much wrong with it.
Built on it last 20-30 years subdivided, straight forward
Remember gets added to cost base to reduce CGT on back end
Something to tell selling agent
I have a friend and parents who are also looking to sell their property and will make the choice based on how well my property sells for
Makes them sell better
Worst deals he ever done -
Sam bought place in WA for $330k from a kid who paid $400k plus selling cost and BA fee
Didn’t want to sell it to someone like the kid as the place was terrible
Sam hit up agents to find any local builders who would buy it
BA paid $355k for a client
Couldn’t renovate the place, it was a demo rebuild job
Sam did deal in Kingston
Hardwood frame high set home was eaten out from termite
$150k-200k budget for renovations
$500k neat, $40k subdivision, $40k demo, $250k for the block
Sam would’ve lost money or broke even if Brisbane didn’t have the growth that it did, he netted $1.1 million
Renovation in Rockhampton $150k
If Rockhampton didn’t have growth he would’ve lost money as the renovations cost increased substantially
Sam doesn’t think market will double again when first home owner scheme comes in
Sam owns 15 properties in Townsville and just sold 2, he thinks there is still good run left in the tank
Run all loan agreements by accountant as they need to document it anyway
Sam does 4 properties per trust
If you try to scale then do 1 to 2 properties per trust
If borrowing is limited with 2 properties per trust then only do 1
Remember to leave borrowing so you can do equity strips to move into next trust

SOP 2 videos coming in $60k and $120k rerecorded
Unit markets right now are hot
Sam just bought a unit in his SMSF 2 weeks ago
House $600k, Unit at $400/450k
Macquarie are pulling out of the game for trusts, new restrictions.

[November 2025] School of Property Q&A
Listen to 5-10 min mark about 4 properties in 1 trust.
Listen to 15-25 min mark about self declaring banks/trusts
Listen to 20-27 min mark about smsf purchasing
Listen to 24-35 min mark about rent and repairs and annoying tenants
Listen to 33-40 min mark about unit market or house with growth
Think about when selling in personal name/trust to put some funds into smsf to reduce tax and help get another deal. But also keep in mind don’t want to handicap journey outside smsf…
Optimise selling
Sell something 30th June 2026, must pay CGT by May 2027
Vs. sell something 1st July 2026, won’t need to pay CGT until May 2028
Utilise capital ASAP. You now have another 20 months before needing to repay that debt so utilise that capital into the market instead of parking in offset until needing to repay the ATO.

Other notes:
Lincoln said: Can use Google Earth to go back decades to see previous property state of extensions
Paul said: Insurance cost replacement value based on purchase price plus 10-15% if justified. He’s used both MCG and BMT tax depreciation experts, both are great.
Pay insurance and council rates from personal name, not from trust account, then reimburse once received account letter
Can fully claim remaining LMI when refinance to another bank
