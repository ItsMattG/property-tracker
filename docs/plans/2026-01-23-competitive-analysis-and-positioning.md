## Executive Summary

PropertyTracker targets a specific underserved segment: **Australian property investors who've built their own spreadsheets** because no existing app meets their needs.

**Core Value Proposition:** "Your spreadsheet, automated."

**Moat:** Investor-grade metrics that no competitor offers:
- "Who Pays" breakdown (Taxman % / Tenant % / You %)
- Useable Equity at 80% AND 88% LVR
- Cash required in offset to break even
- True Profit vs True Cash distinction
- Multi-entity support with ownership-adjusted calculations

## Secret Sauce Features (The Moat)

### 1. "Who Pays" Breakdown

Shows the psychological reframe that makes negative gearing click:

| Who | % | Explanation |
|-----|---|-------------|
| **Taxman** | 16.31% | Your tax deductions × marginal rate |
| **Tenant** | 61.53% | Rent covers this portion of costs |
| **You** | 22.16% | Your actual out-of-pocket |

**Why it matters:** Investors see "-$6,700 loss" and panic. Showing "You only pay 22%" reframes the same number as a win.

### 2. Useable Equity at Multiple LVRs

| Threshold | Useable Equity | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **80% LVR** | $14,069 | No LMI required |
| **88% LVR** | $251,269 | With LMI, for next deposit |

**Why it matters:** "How much can I pull out for my next property?" - answered instantly.

### 3. Cash Required in Offset to Break Even

| Property | Annual Loss | Cash Needed in Offset |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Shepparton | -$6,350 | $92,165 |
| North Bendigo | -$8,791 | $131,406 |
| Durack | -$7,056 | $105,470 |
| **Total** | **-$22,197** | **$329,041** |

**Why it matters:** Gives a concrete savings target.

### 4. True Profit vs True Cash

- **True Profit** = Including tax benefits (paper gain)
- **True Cash** = Actual money in/out of your pocket

**Why it matters:** Accountants talk profit. Your bank account talks cash. Both matter.

### 5. Multi-Entity with Ownership %

Support for:
- Personal (100%)
- Family Trust (100%)
- Unit Trust with partial ownership (25%)
- SMSF
- Company

All calculations adjust for ownership percentage automatically.

## Trust & Reliability Strategy

### Target User Barriers

Users didn't try existing apps because:
1. Didn't know they existed
2. Didn't trust them with sensitive data
3. Assumed they wouldn't handle complexity (trusts, partial ownership)
4. Saw cost as unnecessary when spreadsheets are free
5. Wanted control over their system

### How PropertyTracker Earns Trust

**Data Accuracy:**
- Side-by-side comparison during onboarding (import spreadsheet, show delta)
- Every calculation shows formula + ATO source link
- Auto-categorization shows confidence % and is always editable

**Control & Portability:**
- One-click export: CSV, PDF, JSON, ZIP
- Self-serve export anytime
- Custom categories, custom fields, flexible entity structures

**Security:**
- Bank-grade encryption (AES-256)
- Australian servers (Supabase Sydney)
- Basiq handles bank auth (we never see passwords)
- Read-only access, revocable anytime

**Transparency:**
- Every metric has "How is this calculated?" link
- Every transaction links to source (bank feed ID or manual entry)

1. User uploads existing spreadsheet
