    "The “Cash required in offset to be positive” is the amount you’d need in the

offset account to save enough interest over the year to fully cover the property’s
annual cash loss. It’s calculated by dividing the property’s net loss by the
interest rate — essentially using interest savings to neutralise the negative cash flow."
