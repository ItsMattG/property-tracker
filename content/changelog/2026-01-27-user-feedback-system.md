We've added a new feedback system that lets you:

- **Submit feature requests** - Vote and comment on ideas from other users
- **Report bugs** - Include browser info and steps to reproduce automatically
- **Track progress** - See when your feedback moves to "planned" or "shipped"

Find the feedback options in Settings > Feature Requests and Settings > Bug Reports.
