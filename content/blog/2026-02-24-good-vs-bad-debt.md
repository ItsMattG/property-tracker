Most people are taught that debt is bad. But property investors know there's a critical difference between debt that costs you money and debt that builds wealth.

## What is good debt?

Good debt is borrowing to buy assets that grow in value or generate income. Investment property loans are the textbook example:

- The property appreciates over time
- Rent covers a portion (or all) of the loan repayments
- Interest on investment loans is tax-deductible
- Inflation erodes the real value of the debt

**Example:** A $500,000 investment loan at 6% costs $30,000/year in interest. But the property generates $26,000 in rent, grows 5% ($25,000) in value, and the interest is fully tax-deductible. Your wealth grows despite owing half a million dollars.

## What is bad debt?

Bad debt is borrowing for things that lose value or generate no income:

- Car loans (the car depreciates the moment you drive it out)
- Credit card debt (high interest, no asset)
- Personal loans for holidays or consumer goods

The interest isn't tax-deductible, the asset loses value, and the repayments come entirely from your salary.

## The crossover trap

Many investors accidentally turn good debt into bad debt by:

- Drawing equity from an investment loan to pay personal expenses (mixing loan purposes)
- Not maintaining proper loan structure (separate investment and personal loans)
- Refinancing in ways that muddy the tax-deductible purpose

## The takeaway

Keep your investment debt separate from personal debt. Every dollar of good debt should be clearly traceable to an income-producing asset. Your accountant will thank you at tax time — and so will your portfolio's growth.
