Gearing is simply whether your investment property makes or loses money each year before tax. It's the foundation of every Australian property investor's tax strategy.

## Negative gearing

Your property is **negatively geared** when expenses exceed income. The loss reduces your taxable income.

**Example:** $25,000 rent income – $32,000 expenses (interest, rates, insurance, depreciation) = **–$7,000 loss**. If you're on a 37% marginal tax rate, that saves you $2,590 in tax.

You're spending real money to get a tax deduction — the strategy only works if the property grows in value over time.

## Positive gearing

Your property is **positively geared** when income exceeds expenses. You're making money from day one, but you'll pay tax on the profit.

**Example:** $30,000 rent income – $24,000 expenses = **+$6,000 profit**. At a 37% tax rate, you owe $2,220 extra tax, but you're still $3,780 ahead.

## Which is better?

Neither is inherently better. It depends on your income, goals, and stage of investing:

- **High income earners** often start negatively geared to offset tax, expecting capital growth
- **Investors closer to retirement** prefer positive gearing for cash flow
- **Most properties** shift from negative to positive gearing as rents rise and fixed expenses don't

## The takeaway

Don't chase negative gearing for its own sake. Focus on total return — capital growth plus rental yield minus all costs. Track both sides so you know exactly where you stand at tax time.
