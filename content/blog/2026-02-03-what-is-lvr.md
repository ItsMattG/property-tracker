If you're investing in property, your **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)** is the number that determines how much you can borrow, what interest rate you'll pay, and whether you need Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

## What is LVR?

LVR is your loan amount divided by the property value, expressed as a percentage.

**Example:** You buy a $600,000 property with a $480,000 loan.
LVR = $480,000 ÷ $600,000 = **80%**

## Why 80% is the magic number

Most Australian lenders use 80% as the threshold:

- **Below 80% LVR** — No LMI required, better interest rates, easier approval
- **Above 80% LVR** — LMI applies (a one-off fee that can cost $10,000+), stricter assessment
- **Above 90% LVR** — Fewer lenders will consider your application

## How LVR affects investors

As your property grows in value, your LVR drops. A property purchased at 80% LVR that grows 10% now sits at roughly 73% LVR — unlocking **usable equity** you can borrow against for your next investment.

This is the core engine of portfolio growth: buy, wait for equity gains, then use that equity as a deposit for the next property.

## The takeaway

Track your LVR across every property. When it drops below 80%, you may have enough usable equity to fund your next deposit without saving a cent.
